Trump ending \#stimulus talks til after the election is literally Bobby Newport saying if he doesn't win, he'll take away the Sweetums jobs. As Leslie Knope says, ""I love this town, &amp; when you love something, you don't threaten it."" Trump never loved America. He just loves power.

SgtDusty,1602029794,g7ycbya,Fundamentally wrong about the funny part. He's not funny. Maybe a laugh once in a while. Office has better writing and everyone knows it.

Mose-Schrute-,1602030125,g7ycwkh,"All his moments are iconic. Also I have watched the show several times and his character is anything but poorly written. Your point is essentially just that he’s a libertarian, yet hates vegans.

Princely-Principals,1602030231,g7yd326,"Ron’s whole character is a bit hypocritical. He hates the government for wasting money, while he wastes tax payer money doing nothing at his job. He is also very opinionated, but isn’t uncompromising. He is willing to forsake his values when his friends need him. For example, he hates fruit, but eats a banana because he loves Diane and her kids. He supports Leslie, even though he hates big government, because she’s his friend. I think you’re confusing Libertarian with Liberal. Libertarian’s are neither Left Wing nor Right Wing. They just want less government, which tends to be more Right Wing than anything. He’s an outdoorsman, not in the sense he wants to provide everything himself, but in the sense he likes the outdoors, likes spending time there, and would prefer to make his own stuff. He is shown to be perfectly happy purchasing stuff from people. I’m not sure what you’re referring to in terms of the gun and hunting stuff; he’s shown perfectly capable at hunting. This isn’t poor writing, rather it’s good writing. A character with no depth is boring. All these things add to his character, and shows his character growth over the course of the show. I think you’re just looking  at his character on the surface. You must also suspend your disbelief a little bit when you are watching TV.

Now let’s get to the point of this post. I’m all for sharing opinions, as long as one can have a reasonable debate. However, this post is clearly meant to invoke a negative response from fans. That makes you a troll.",t3_j6gbn1,/r/PandR/comments/j6gbn1/ron_is_the_worst_written_character_of_them_all/g7yd326/,3,PandR,comment,2020-10-06

Then she’s recalled. She constantly talks about wanting to be the first female president one day. She goes to Washington. She meets Michelle Obama once and Biden twice. I could go on but it’s pretty obvious what the show is about. 
It’s one of the reasons why me and my wife love it so much, even though we’re not Americans, because we both work in the public sector and some things are universal in government and politics (unlike Knope, we don’t wish to get into politics, but surely it’s present in a lot of what we see and deal with at work).",t1_g7uuvup,/r/PandR/comments/j5hnsf/chip_mccapp_vibes_from_trump_today/g7uvlcf/,1,PandR,comment,2020-10-05

Also, you do know that satire draws humor from real life situations, right? Sure it’s exaggerated for comedic purposes, but the reason ppl find it so funny it’s because it’s so close to reality.

DedAlreadyActual,1601781605,g7lw75w,"dude.  seriuously.   everyones playing politics.  They're not the same, they're just being shitty to each other.

seriously, stfu and stop trying to act like your side is somehow a moral paragon.

They're not.   They're a political party doing partisan political bullshit, pandering, and propagandizing.    Everything and everyone other than your guy has to be the worst thing imaginable or you might actually listen to something else for a moment.

get over yourself and stop thinking any of these people are defenders of your way of life - they arent - no one has fought to actually do anything that substantially makes OUR lives better since the fucking 20's labor movement, and womens sufferage shortly after that, and abolishment of jim crowe many years later.   Its fucking rare.    You will find substantially more decisions made by every side that have made your lives worse.   

we aint gotten shit since thats made any significant impact on our daily lives and quality of life since, and that isnt a mistake.

like seriously.   Name something in your lifetime that made your personal life significantly better?   what has a politician changed for YOU that makes your life more manageable and increased your personal wealth and ability to save?

if you have a hard time naming one then maybe you should consider the idea that none of these people are really all that concerned with your well being.

just because i pointed out their bullshit attitudes and conduct are similar doesnt mean im equating them to be the same.

I don't remember the peach scene, but I do remember the scene where he can't bring himself to eat a banana without putting it inside a Paunch Burger. I just found that stupid.

I guess I can't really change your mind, but I personally don't *love* the character. The strict 'principles' he lives by are just unfunny to me, and baseless. 'Government bad' 'freemarket onwy' 'no one can know anything about me'... it all gets old quickly. They are illogical and generally unfunny views in my opinion.

Also, Nick Offerman is short and ugly and just doesn't really exude manliness to me. If a character is going to be obsessed with masculinity, then I at least want him to appear masculine.

But we're living in a country with a pandemic, massive race riots, 200K dead, and you *honestly* think that your life is being deprived because you have to *download* an app and *watch advertisements* so you can watch a show for free. I have 0 sympathy for you. I am not some 'rich 1%' type, I'm a fucking night custodian dude. I just got off my last graveyard shift for the week. I'm technically an 'essential worker' at a State College that spends his entire week disinfecting class rooms. I just cannot give less of a fuck about your complaint that you have to watch ads.

And again I want to be clear-- I'm VERY sympathetic to all kinds of problems. I'm not saying just because you are healthy and what not you have no right to bitch about anything. But find something else to bitch about other than the fact that you have to download an app to get a show with ads for Free. I just have zero sympathy for you and will continue to express this opinion here even if I get 10,000 comments downvoted to oblivion because it's just stupid to me.

We used to live in a world where the ONLY way to get your favorite show was to buy it boxset outright. Now in the US we can watch it infinitely for free, and everyone here is bitching. I just have no tolerance or respect for that stance right now, personally.

So yeah, you can take that sarcastic crap and stick it you-know-where I guess.",t1_g6j67o6,/r/PandR/comments/izgi97/park_and_rec_to_leave_amazon_prime_netflix_and/g6j7dxb/,1,PandR,comment,2020-09-25

amortizedeeznuts,1600806718,g6913c2,"Your point that what?  That saying things causticallly, even if I make valid points, is in advertently making white people more anti-asian?

If white people become more racist against asians because of my comments, it's because they are choosing to do so. To believe otherwise is victim blaming. The object of racism is not way responsible for the sentiments of the racist. Telling me I should talk or act different to accommodate the comfort zone of racist people is condoning their racism.

Your point that I need to come from a place of compassion and understanding? Read the responses to my original post. You assume the are responding to the edit, but once again, the edit is responding to them. Read the responses as if the edit was not there, because it wasn't when the vitriol began. Now go tell those racist white people to come from a place of compassion and understanding.

Being partisan does not equate endorsing a system that did not and could not have existed in the 1780's. Through out american history there have been periods of multiple (3+) parties having significant influence. Even periods of multiple parties having factions within their parties vying for opposite goals. The modern two party system did not truly coming into being until the early 20th century and even it did not set itself in stone in its current form until the late 60's. 

The founding father's simply could not have even begun to imagine the forces that hold our partisan structure in place, let alone legislate for it. Thinking otherwise ascribes near mystical foresight to men whose goal was to establish a government that served their class interests at the time. Partisan structures served only to advocate for contradicting opinions within that framework.

charlesthe42nd,1600054218,g574df6,"Ron and Donna seem reasonable to me, at least as TV shows go. 

Ron is the oldest of the bunch (besides Jerry), is the highest ranking (in parks) and should be highest paid. He mentioned that he started working when he was like 14 and likely has been saving for a long time. He lives modestly: drives a ~15-year-old car, lives in a relatively small home in a more rural area, doesn’t even own a cell phone, computer, tv, cable, etc. — he has basically no actual expenses except his wood shop, food and whiskey. 

Donna’s always had a side hustle like Tom, but she’s more responsible with her money and seems to be better at making it. She appears to be a pretty successful real estate agent on the side in the later seasons, which could bring in a decent amount if she’s focusing on luxury homes, which wouldn’t surprise me.",t1_g56ts0j,/r/PandR/comments/irzguj/found_this_in_the_wild/g574df6/,16,PandR,comment,2020-09-13

There are shows that are available just with Prime membership, they’re denoted with a PRIME banner across the top-left of the thumbnails. Stargate SG-1 used to have that banner, I don’t know for how long. But it was long enough for me to watch from S01E01 to S07E10ish until a month or so ago.

But here’s where it gets stupid. I just checked right now, and they’re relisted?! My progress is gone (no biggie) but now Atlantis seasons 2 and 4 aren’t available (I rewatched the whole series before SG-1, so that’s just annoying but not a problem). SGU is available along with Origins, which I’ve never seen.

Honestly you could just skip the entire final season of this show and it would be damn near perfect.

The rumors that were circulating back in 2014-ish were that season 6 was written and shot with the show's entire future being uncertain. The show wasn't renewed for season 7 until right when season 6 was wrapping up it's original airings.

Because of this they very impressively wrote the end of season 6 as a potential series finale and tied up all the loose ends but also opened the door for the ""3 years into the future"" plot line if they ended up being renewed.",t1_g4dq1ds,/r/PandR/comments/ioa46x/i_regret_nothing_the_end/g4e3uaf/,4,PandR,comment,2020-09-07

Marketing, vote manipulation, getting around bans, getting around minimum karma requirements 

Who buys them, the people that would need them for the above reasons.

Here is a site where you can buy them.

[here](https://upvotes4reddit.com/buy-reddit-accounts)
&gt;
 

&gt;Buying Reddit accounts helps marketers, professionals and regular Redditors make their point stronger and defeat their opponents arguments. The majority of people everywhere follow the masses, and Reddit is no exception. Once your link gets enough upvotes, it crawls up to the first page and gives you all the exposure for your ideas that you can dream of.

&gt;But how do you submit these links ? You can always use our upvoting service to upvote, but how do you submit the link itself ? The answer is via mature and quality accounts with lots of karma. This will give the link an extra ranking boost and will increase it’s chances to actually get submitted (and not manually removed).

&gt;You also need accounts in order to write the positive comments below your link. Once there, all the comments that support you and your goals should get all the support they can through as many upvotes as possible. But you always need these supportive comments in the first place, and this is the second reason why you need good Reddit accounts for your marketing campaign.",t1_g4apkik,/r/PandR/comments/inyhd8/got_an_amazing_xmas_present/g4aq11r/,1,PandR,comment,2020-09-06

pineapple132,1599353539,g46r4vs,"Obviously April is a caricature but I think they portray her as ultimately caring for these people and for Andy. Like she helps campaign for Leslie, try to help Andy find his dream, believe in him for police training, etc. I feel like at the end of the day April comes through. Personally I find her hilarious. Compare her with Tom, who also is pretty funny, but constantly fucks Leslie over by putting his needs first (not bringing Def to the phone-a-thon, talking about 720 the entire meeting with local business owners, and doing a similar thing to Ben in some episode too. While he always privately has something really nice to say or has prepared a thoughtful presentation which he shows privately, publicly he ALWAYS fucks the person over. April,

Still-ILO,1599005246,g3nsgrm,"&gt; But imagine your ENTIRE SCHOOL is named after the worst person you've ever met! Where do you even begin?

Yep.  Brigham Young was a scoundrel of the first order.  He was not only sickeningly racist, even for his time (and was a northerner), but he was at least partially at fault for the needless death and suffering experienced by Mormon pioneers, some having traveled from Europe, to go to ""Zion"".

So it starts with a so called actual, real prophet of God that is so clueless as to encourage pioneers to start across the plains way too late in the year.  It ends up with the church exploiting the pain, suffering and loss it had caused by pointing to how faithful the victims were* and telling current members to use those people as examples to stay faithful no matter what.

*Oh, and to add insult to injury, many of the pioneers had little to no money and what assistance they received from the church to migrate to Utah they HAD TO PAY BACK!!  Yep, no lie, there was what was called the perpetual immigration fund and when people made it to ""Zion"" they were informed they would have to pay it back.  No wonder people ""stayed faithful"" when they've been made indentured servants and are put upon to stick around and work until they've paid back their ""debt"".  No doubt at least some, if not many, would have left and been done with it all, had they felt they had the freedom to do so.",t1_g3kywpx,/r/PandR/comments/ik0tic/mormon_temple_murals_looking_like_pawnee_city_hall/g3nsgrm/,3,PandR,comment,2020-09-01

SeedyRedwood,1598310795,g2qsbyf,"I get what you’re saying but the joke has a much bigger and sweet meaning if you really look at it from start to finish.

And Leslie switching gears to hate on Jerri makes it even better. Everyone hates Gerry. Gary fucks up at work all the time. At work, Jeri is a loser. Garry, the mayor of Pawnee for decades gets his tombstone spelled wrong. That’s the joke and for people that go through life getting bullied or picked on, that is tough to watch.

But all that doesn’t bother him. He never lashes out. He never blows up at someone. Why?

Because when Jerry goes home, he is married to the most beautiful woman in Indiana with three of the most beautiful daughters. Jerry is a hero at home. Jerry never fucks up at home. And has the best life at home.

What that tells me is that no matter what is going on in the outside world, your job, your co-workers, people hate you, you make mistakes, etc. If you keep your home life straight and you are a hero to your spouse and children, everything in your life will be fine.",t3_ifzj7o,/r/PandR/comments/ifzj7o/my_only_real_problem_with_the_jerry_subplot_is/g2qsbyf/,2,PandR,comment,2020-08-24

I came up with the general plot and premise of a jury duty oriented Parks and Rec episode the one and only time that I went to jury duty (never made the jury panel but was still there for 1.5 days when they were vetting the potential jurors). I was gonna write a script on it and get more in-depth while adding sub-plots for the other characters but never really had the time or remembered to do it.

disgustandhorror,1598241920,g2nqhe6,"That's an interesting theory, but really the writers just realized what a poorly utilized, boring character he was. The show didn't really hit its stride until (this is debatable) midway through season 2, and they decided it was better to just pretend he never existed. 

He was supposed to be the ""Jim from the Office"" straight-man the audience could relate to among this cast of wacky characters. When they realized that didn't work at all and he had no chemistry with Leslie, they tried turning him into a womanizing horndog... that made him even less likable. Soooo they stuck him with Ann, which similarly failed. 

They did everything they could think of, but in the end Mark was just consistently the worst part of the show. It got a lot better when he left, but it does kinda suck because I actually really like Paul Schneider.",t1_g2najvs,/r/PandR/comments/ife71w/does_it_still_bother_anyone_else_that_they_spent/g2nqhe6/,3,PandR,comment,2020-08-24

ChaosFinalForm,1598243534,g2nssnc,"Honestly I didn't hate Mark. I don't enjoy that part of the show as much because I definitely think Ben and Chris bring a lot more to the show, along with the way some of the other characters evolved around that time such as Andy and Tom.

wesbug,1598141994,g2j9rmi,"Thankyou so much this is an amazing unexpected treat.

I'd love to see the next scene where SMT as the CEO of Sweetums takes a call from Lesley about some horrible thing they've done. Bobby rides through the room on a pony with their 10 year old granddaughter and asks who she's talking to. Lesley Knope dear. Oh the race lady. SMT looks puzzled, we see Lesley smile warmly, remembering. SMT proceeds to tell Lesley to fuck off in super complicated legalese/corporate-speak that ends with how she's actually accomplishing sweeping reform and it was a political meneuver to oust old leadership. She then thanks her for choosing her on galentines day that time, and for being kind, and a role model. Lesley, defeated but clearly impressed, concedes and wishes her well. They both hang up. A crash is heard. Ah, I fell in the pony poo Shauna, says Bobby from the other room. The granddaughter is heard laughing. The pony neighs. Shauna smiles.

Buddhabellyrub,1597792545,g21l7jl,"Jobs are a secondary issue. The bigger issue is that police stop black people (because these poorer communities are often heavily African American due to the effects of segregation) at rates much greater than white people, are charged more for committing the exact same crime, and are given longer sentences for the exact same crime (not my opinion btw, literal facts). Plus even if they are innocent, poor people who cannot post bail might be forced to take a deal just so they can get back to their family or job that they’re dependent on.  This “increased crime rate” is used to justify putting more police in these communities which in fact leads to an even greater disparity in arrests between black and white people in this country. And because our prison system does not rehabilitate, people released cannot get jobs, or renter society in any meaningful way, and are often left with no choice but to break the law again, leading to a vicious cycle that has devastated these communities. 
“Tax incentives” may help a tiny bit, but what would help a lot more is to instead invests tax payer money into programs that seek to help people in these communities survive, and of course to change the whole system that fucked them over in the first place.",t1_g1z1hkd,/r/PandR/comments/iaixtv/parks_will_never_not_be_relevant/g21l7jl/,1,PandR,comment,2020-08-18

Buddhabellyrub,1597795346,g21qf1n,"There is more to the story than just “they commit more crime.” Black people are 2.7 times more likely to be incarcerated for drug related crimes despite a similar rate of drug use.  Black people are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession that White people despite comparable rates of use. Black people are far more likely to be searched and arrested in routine traffic stops. What you’ve said still doesn’t explain sentencing disparities between black and white people.

Also the idea that our prisons try to rehabilitate is a joke. The process for obtaining a degree in prison is incredibly difficult to achieve, so acting like this is in any way representative of a large portion of incarcerated people is incorrect. (Although some states are doing better on this front than others.) Also we have a rate of recidivism of about 70% for prisoners three years after release.

That's why his wife never leaves him. That's why he so easily pretended something happened with Leslie, he'd done it a million times before. like they said several times, the scandals help his career, so why not just  ride it out?

Pitkitus figured it out, and is threatening to go public. Dexhart isn't fighting him, cause so far hes only had dexhart do some minor things (someone think of minor things he could have him do) and they seem innocent and unconnected. turns out pitkitus has some master prank planned, and hes been quietly setting it up this entire time (insert amazing elaborate prank here). leslie tries to stop him the whole episode. in the end, she figures it out, but it's too late. the prank succeeds.

djthememelord,1597186673,g15kegt,"Vice presidential candidates aren't typically picked based on race/gender, but instead chosen to cover any weaknesses the top of the ticket has. 

For example, Obama was seen as inexperienced, especially in foreign policy. So, for his VP he picked Biden, a longtime senator who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Trump did the same thing in 2016, he didn't pick Pence because he was a white man, he picked him because he was also seen as lacking experience, and Pence was a well established conservative politician. Pence also helped appeal to the Christian Republican base, which Trump didn't appeal to.

GrandMoffNoff,1596667977,g0hy766,"I've seen 2 schools of thought in trying to figure this out.

1) The Lafayette/West Lafayette connection seems to be a sociological and economic pair to Pawnee/Eagleton.

2) Based on a Youtube video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f818fz1lAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f818fz1lAY)) it's either in Lafayette/West Lafayette area, but more likely it's closer to New Albany.

In re-watching the scene, he says 6 months from now is May 19th, so their end of the world event would be November 19th.

Using [watherspark.com](https://watherspark.com) as a common site for looking up the climatology I found the following for November 19th.  


|Location|Morning Avg. (8:00am)|Afternoon Avg. (2:00pm)|Night Avg. (11:00pm)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|West Lafayette, IN|38F|47F|40F|
|New Albany, IN|42F|51F|45F|

Of course, this average is still pretty chilly so I'd guess that wind would really make the difference. 45F with no wind is borderline manageable in fall-attire, but any wind does make it a bit more questionable if they'd be warm enough with what they have on.",t1_g0hu393,/r/PandR/comments/i49o5d/plot_hole_s4e6_end_of_the_world/g0hy766/,1,PandR,comment,2020-08-05

Solodolo0203,1596504994,g0a4tri,"&gt;	I feel that mental health issues should be classified the same as physical health

I get what you mean but I feel that a lot of the issues that come with diagnosing/addressing mental health issues are inherently different from physical health as there are clear guidelines/metrics for physical health but not for mental health. I agree that that mental health overall though should be considered the same way we consider physical health.

&gt;	Additionally it is well studied that when one person does better, that tends to be contagious, therefore it being widespread in more communities would lead to better outcomes across the board.

That makes sense and could even explain the opposite (poor mental health being contagious as well). With the current trend however it seems like we’re going to reach a point where everybody feels as if they need to see a therapist and that’s “normal”. Of course therapy might be the only effective option for some but I’m noticing a shift in people taking less responsibility for their own mental health and blaming lack of services/other aspects of society. 

I’m no expert in this field but I just feel as if therapy in a way is a privilege, not a right. You’re essentially paying a highly educated stranger to sort your thoughts/listen to you vent and help you work out life long problems. Any person could benefit from that whether they were depressed etc or not which is why the cost/availability barrier for therapy may always be necessary. In my opinion there needs to be much more research and long term measures to improve young people’s mental health rather than just increasing therapy access/making it free as the mental health decline is clearly systemic",t1_g09yg0i,/r/PandR/comments/i2xi0f/mood_after_being_stuck_at_home_for_over_4_months/g0a4tri/,1,PandR,comment,2020-08-03

FrostyWaffles_,1595977789,fzkbuk2,"Sister City (Season 2, Episode 5) 

It’s basically just an episode that adds nothing to the characters imo, maybe just reaffirmed that Donna was awesome lol. It was really only the one storyline and it got boring. I also felt like they had one joke the whole episode and it was “Venezuela is better than the US, look how rich we are” which either aged really well or very poorly, depending on how you see it lol.

The person you responded to didn't seem to be implying that this was the responsibility of teachers, or even that because of these things we should have in person school. They just brought up that real challenges exisit. 

I don't think bringing up concerns about having the needed tools and routines for kids with special needs should be met with scorn. 

Even taking special education out of the equation, I don't think parents not having an adequate routine that allows for remote learning AND their full time work, is a parental failing.

The worry many families are feeling about childcare are valid.

Jennrrrs,1595901013,fzgx3lw,"I've witnessed it as well. A teacher posted about how parents are going to have to ""come together"" to get through this. I asked them to elaborate what that meant and their idea was that parents will have to take turns watching groups of children. 

So this person expects us parents (like we all know eachother and are super close) to offer up our homes as makeshift schools. I personally don't know any of the other parents. I never got to meet any due to my work hours. But now I'm supposed to send my kids, one with a peanut allergy, to parents I've never even met and trust that they're qualified to not only care for but also educate my kids? And that they wear their masks and dont go out unnecessarily? And then they're supposed to trust me to do it when its my turn? 

Its not really about not wanting the kids home. Its that there is no alternative for many families and yes, its not fair for the teachers, but we're not being given any other solution. If we don't have unemployment to get by on, we have to work and that means our kids have to go somewhere.",t1_fzg504d,/r/PandR/comments/hylts8/people_against_online_learning/fzgx3lw/,2,PandR,comment,2020-07-27

Trump eliminated thousands of job killing regulations and is constantly working to keep the government out of our lives. Just because you dont see these things happening doesn't mean they arent.

I started watching Parks and Rec a few weeks ago and couldn’t stop watching.

Parks is definitely more consistently funny imo, with the office having the funnier highs of the two, but for SURE the reason I prefer Parks is the more rounded ensemble cast. Parks has less characters to focus on which allows them to have a more balanced focus. instead of focusing on 4 main characters and like 12 secondary characters, parks has 10 characters that share most of the screen time, and while Leslie is clearly the focus of the show, she still has fairly even screentime with Ron, April, Ben, Chris and Ann.",t1_fz7nhl3,/r/PandR/comments/hxift1/bad_timing/fz9746c/,1,PandR,comment,2020-07-25

&gt; My roommate and his girlfriend got in the shower together and they're...Talking about politics?   

&gt; I was expecting to hear ""OH GOD, HARDER,"" not ""George Washington was entirely correct in his prediction of what distinct parties would do to politics as a whole.""   

Nope nevermind, there it is, apparently political debate is just their form of foreplay

In the timeline of the show, he wasn’t quite practiced or educated enough to use his pranks to make clear political statements, so Leslie takes it personally.

catsbluepajamas,1595464697,fyxjufd,"Tom sold his business “Rent a swag” which he started from the ground up with an investment from his own savings and from his friends and largely Ron.

Toms bistro was his baby and he made sacrifices to make it work. It takes off right away thanks to the unity concert and the people of Indiana flocked too.

IMO, the weaker episodes of TGP are the first few at the start of each season which made me question if I should continue each time a new season popped up. Regardless, It does deserve a full watch through and the ending is extremely satisfying as far as tv show endings go. 

Both are good shows and offer different experiences. And like all experiences, not all experience are for all people.

Most reviews I've read are positive, which is why I contemplated watching the whole series, just in case I haven't got to the point where it was worth watching.  I think I'll give up on it, and move on.

I read a Buzzfeed list on the funniest things/scenes on TGP (despite it possibly spoiling things) and I'd seen a lot of them, in the show, and thought if these are the funniest things, I think I'd rather waste my time on other things I've seen before, and found way more funny.",t1_fytvxrc,/r/PandR/comments/hvkllq/love_pandr_not_a_fan_of_the_good_place_anyone_else/fytybqv/,1,PandR,comment,2020-07-21

This applies to masks/stickers/shirts/mugs/posters/etc...

This spam is becoming an issue on Reddit. Often the accounts posting the product, those asking for a link and those offering the link are all involved. Usually newer accounts, often all three are the same age and have very low karma. Other times accounts may look to have been dormant for years only to start posting links to merchandise within the last few days (possibly compromised or purchased accounts). 

There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment and product preview images.

I can’t even begin to tell you how many  products I have seen with the exact same striped background, even in the same color, flogged by these scammers. It has to be at least 50 different things, across dozens of subjects. They aren’t even creative. Lazy designs and lazy marketing or scamming. 

Often, accounts will scrub their history to hide their shilling.

The broken English nonsense descriptions are also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertently hilarious). When you buy the product, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality item with a fuzzy blurry print.

Be careful, friends!

But the difference between that idiotic thinking and being pro-choice is that if someone decides to have an abortion, there's zero chance of that abortion spreading to others who want to have their children and killing a not-insignificant portion of the mothers at the same time.

Calling people who want others to wear masks ""pro-mandatory"" with any negative connotation implied, is like calling people ""pussies"" for not wanting you to point your possibly loaded gun in their face.

buildingbridges,1594778706,fy3p11s,"So I don’t quite understand your question but I’m still gonna to try to answer it. COVID is mostly speed through droplets people expel coming into contact with other people’s mucus membranes (eyes, mouth, nose.) The problem is that some people are asymptomatic and even more are contagious before they start showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic.)

If we all wear masks over our nose and mouth they help keep our droplets to ourselves in case we’ve caught COVID and don’t know it. They may also help us not breathe in other people’s droplet but the research is mixed still because cloth masks are a pretty new way of trying to stop the spread of viruses. If when people cough, sneeze, or breathe their masks keep in particles then they don’t end up on other surfaces you touch or in your nose, mouth it eyes and you don’t get sick. 

It’s also important to remember that you should try not to touch your face or mask, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer, and to disinfect your mask. You can disinfect your mask in several ways including washing, ironing, or putting it in the oven. 

I don’t know if you’re in the US but if you are I don’t even know if we’re in the middle yet. Many other countries has strict lockdowns for weeks or months. Since the virus can take up to 2 weeks to show symptoms a lockdown of 4 weeks would allow for 2 cycles of the incubation time of the virus to pass. Once the general public isn’t infecting/reinfecting themselves contact tracers can follow up with people who test positive to see who they can in contact with and warn others that they need to quarantine because they were exposed. Also as more data is coming out it’s looking like catching COVID won’t keep you from catching it again, the newest reports estimate that immunity only lasts a few months.",t1_fy3jozp,/r/PandR/comments/hr6cqt/made_this_today_and_felt_it_was_very_fitting_to/fy3p11s/,7,PandR,comment,2020-07-14

Usually newer accounts, often all three are the same age and have very low karma.

Tom Haverford- Charms (almost way too eager to teach about charms that do nothing but make your robes various shades of fly. He always shows up to class in some of the most ridiculous garbs) Slytherin

Ann Perkins- Nurse (recent entry. Generally warns boys from getting intentionally injured in quidditch practice just to see her) Hufflepuff

Garry Gergich- Muggle Studies (is actually a muggle married to a witch... why is this not a thing in Harry Potter?) not a wizard

Chris Traeger- Potions (his potions are all supplements that are designed to help you or antidotes. He's very good, but only brews things that you can drink) Ravenclaw

Craig Middlebrook- Astronomy (Will shout the lesson at you for no reason, but is very accurate about his predictions. However, the subject has no business being this loud) Ravenclaw

Jean Ralphio Sapperstein- ??? (literally not qualified, but here tries to get in anyway because he needs the money) Hufflepuff

Tammy 2- Librarian (Is in a distant annex on campus in a government appointed position. Is never invited on premise. Ever.) Slytherin. 

Bobby Newport- Minister of Magic (and running for reelection) hufflepuff

These weren’t loans for businesses that needed cash flow due to Covid, they were designed to encourage businesses to keep staff employed instead of furloughing them. There were separate EIDL loans that are 30 year loans that can be used for all operating costs.

lil_lost_boy,1594079426,fx5iz9d,"That analysis just lets politicians off the hook for unjustly harming members of our communities which is problematic and myopic on your part. The novelty of declaring our criminal justice system racist, a view being promoted more and more, is that it bypasses deflections regarding motives and intentions of individual politicians. The racist criminal justice system and one of its chief accelerators, the '94 crime bill, do in fact single out and impact members of black, Latino, etc. communities, making them racist. Whatever their motives, these politicians created racist legislation by virtue of who was targeted by it. I'm comfortable with all responsible parties being given blame. You have people like Sanders and H. Clinton who have apologized for their support, then you have Biden who's expressed continued support for the legislation despite what it's led to.

The wealthy don't become so because they work harder or smarter, but because they buy assets with their surplus income that make money for them without their having to work at all. 

If you're starting from nothing, then you obviously need to work to get the initial money to buy those assets. Alternatively, get lucky and win the lottery, either at conception or after. But it's not the work (or the lottery winnings) that gets you wealthy. It's being an owner of the machines that work for you.
