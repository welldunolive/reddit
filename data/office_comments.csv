Phyllis is nice. When she shows she actually can be mean even just casually, I think it shows she opts to be kind and civil most of the time, though has her inner bitch and personal faults that don‚Äôt ever seem to affect her business in the work place. 

She‚Äôs nice, interesting, intelligent, stable- just not a pushover, and a little bit of a sociopath. 10/10 would work with her over Angela. 

Okay like if she was a pushover, it would be to make you think she‚Äôs a pushover, but eventually she would just pay someone to murder you and make it look like an accident.

So that‚Äôs where my issues with Phyllis come in I guess. She never goes up to 11 because she‚Äôs never consistent enough to establish a baseline, so she can never really take it to 11.

Hell, let's make this even worse. I live an hour south of Atlanta, some what rural, they don't provide Internet. 2 blocks away they do, but not my block. So I have to pay extra on my cell phone plan for 100gigs a month for HotSpot. No shit...Fucking ridiculous. It does last every month but..come on. 
I see ur point and actually took it to heart my friend. I can tell you with most certainty that I too will not subscribe to PissCock...even though I have the series on Dvd...thats not the point.

niketyname,1601250970,g6wibv4,"My thoughts on the show:

It‚Äôs soo good! The acting is actually pretty good for what Indian shows are and they do make it as cringey as we expect. It‚Äôs like rewatching the Office but with some new things. I think they changed things culturally pretty well that keeps things interesting and the writing is pretty clever especially when it comes to slang and dirty jokes. 

I‚Äôm not 100% into ‚ÄúDwight‚Äù but I would say that he portrays season 1-2 Dwight pretty well. 

This show is on Hotstar and on Season 2. Hope it keeps going because I love it!!!!

PlazmahGrenade,1601076218,g6l35pi,"Basically the blu ray discs themselves can hold more data than traditional DVDs, so the video files are larger and higher quality as a result. 

I believe the name itself also comes from the laser that reads the discs, as it is blue whereas standard dvd players have a red one. 

But they charge more and the dvds have the same content as far as I can tell. So if your not after the absolute highest resolution it's a steal of a value for the standard box set.

MonkSalad1,1600642304,g61iasi,"I'd recommend watching the show again. Yes, with so much of his older family being involved in Nazi endeavours to some extent, and him even saying something to the effect of Germany should have won World War Two, it is a running joke that he might be a Nazi sympathiser, and therefore possibly a white supremacist.

But notice that I'm saying might and could be? There's nowhere near the evidence needed to make the claim, especially since it was his Grandfather who was a Nazi and not him.

For context, his Grandfather probably fought for Germany in WW2. So that's an obvious one right? But saying Dwight is likely a white supremacist is like saying I hate gay people because homosexuality was illegal in my country when my grandmother was my age.

Think about it.

It was just drama for the sake of drama, IMO, especially in that last season. 

OP, I also think Jim can be not so great (Pam too). I always thought they were so nice but there were a ton of characters they really weren‚Äôt nice to, for no good reason.

Jim also has that ""snarky underachiever"" thing going for most of the show's tenure. That attitude is amusing when you're 20 years old. But as you grow older, the guy who's too cool to take anything seriously attitude gets tiresome. 

My favorite example of this is when Jim jokes that he doesn't care who he picks as the new manager and several employees get pissed at him.

That's an incredibly arrogant thought process. 

""Silence peons, you aren't a part of the chosen committee therefore your opinions are trash"" 

They deserve to have their concerns respectfully heard. Or let me frame it this way: 

If you're at your job, and someone just gives you jokey answers to something you're legitimately concerned about should you be ""shut down"" because you aren't in a committee or in management? 

Oh and to acknowledge this: 

&gt; they go to the one guy, who they know is actually trying to solve a problem 

No they don't ""know"" anything. Because as you pointed out, they aren't on the committee and the meetings are behind closed doors.

MageSentron,1600645263,g61oa1n,"Tim was a dick, but it worked because David was an even bigger dick.

No, you didn't read that wrong and I didn't spell ""Jim"" wrong.  The Office is a remake and because of that, it had problems selling the characters to a brand new audience on the other side of a vast ocean with a very different culture and work-life.

The Office (US) kept that formula for at least the first few seasons because S1 was basically a remake.

So Jim became a dick because he could be the audience character, getting back at Michael and Michael's supporters (Dwight, Packer, etc).

As the series grew and American audiences warmed up to Michael due to Steve Carrell's natural charisma, they had to move Michael's character further away from David Brent.

Unfortunately by softening Michael and moving him away from the archetype of David, the first boss of The Office, they were left with Jim STILL seeming like a dick.  I think that's why they moved Jim to another branch and introduced Andy.

First, it allowed us to see Jim in a sympathetic situation, a ""fish out of water"" moment, if you will, and it also allowed the show to grow Michael a little without Jim being the constant focus.

Let's look at how Andy ""fixed"" Jim.

Remember Jim only looking at the camera because of Michael?  It's a little dick-ish, isn't it?  He's communicating to the audience that he dislikes working there and dislikes his boss.

Michael is running around for several episodes worried he's going to lose his job and just when he finds out everything is ""fine"" and he's not going to get fired, Michael has to put up with a Yes-Man WAY worse than anything Dwight was capable of and finds it repulsive.  Suddenly Michael is looking at the audience for sympathy and out of frustration.

Meanwhile Jim gets back to his old dick-ish pranks, right?

Not exactly.  Suddenly Andy punches a hole in the wall and Jim's whole shtick drops away and he gets back to work. From then on, sure, he still pranked Dwight but it was much less mean spirited and the growth towards them becoming friends started to roll.

I think the softening of Jim was done masterfully and although it did mean we'd have a season of hating Andy, it also gave us a season of getting to know Michael and Jim better.

And Jim was no longer an American version of Tim Canterbury.",t3_iwnwky,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/iwnwky/the_more_ive_seen_the_office_the_more_i_feel_like/g61oa1n/,10,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-09-20

laneabu,1600645403,g61oims,Jim and Pam were both selfish assholes in their own way. Jim did take the pranking too far making andy go crazy and he lied to pam about athlead for a long time he was super unprofessional but compared to the rest of the people there he looked more professional I guess. Pam was an asshole about jim going to work in philly when she felt it was a okay to go off with Michael when he tried to start his own company and she just up and went to art school. She also is rude about the party planning comity a lot as well. They are good together but definitely do have flaws,t3_iwnwky,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/iwnwky/the_more_ive_seen_the_office_the_more_i_feel_like/g61oims/,2,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-09-20

One of the little boys skateboarding comes up to her and I guess he asks if he can pet it and she says yes. A couple seconds later she starts moving away from the boy but the dog kept looking at the little boy, she tells the kid to go away and he starts walking to whoever‚Äôs recording and the dog follows , so this Karen comes to the boy and literally pushes the little kid and starts yanking the dog hard to follow her... like.

The cycle of abuse can be a slow process, but it's pretty normal for a partner to change drastically after getting married and becoming abusive. I'm not saying that Roy definitely would have done that, but his reaction to finding out about Jim was intense and a red flag for abusive behavior. That and him being controlling and instead of pushing Pam to pursue her dreams, he told her it's pointless and convinced her not to take the graphic design course Jan recommended to her.

For instance in yours if the letter was C and the first sound was distorted they wouldn‚Äôt be able to rely on the second sound to know it was C if K is kelly, because chili and kelly both end in a ‚Äúlee‚Äù sound.

It‚Äôll sync to your computer using Resilio to the folder of your choosing, but I don‚Äôt know how to auto move it out of that folder into another one. So what I did was add that resilio folder to my plex so when a show downloads and syncs to my computer plex will still add it automatically to my server. So what happens is Sonarr tells Seedbox to download show &gt; when show finishes downloading it gets auto moved to Resilio folder on server &gt; then it starts syncing to Resilio folder on my computer. Every so often if it‚Äôs a show or movie I want to keep and not just watch once, I‚Äôll move it from the Resilio sync folder (named ResilioTV and has a 300GB limit, because of the seedbox limit, combined with my ResilioMovies folder) and put it in my PlexTV folder.

AnEvenNicerGuy,1599172991,g3wz061,"Michael is his own worst enemy. However much he improves (which I think he does in leaps and bounds) he remains his own worst enemy. It isn‚Äôt that I ignore the negatives and focus on the positives; it‚Äôs that his positives take effort and self-awareness and focus. When he loses focus he falls back into his negative ways. He is excitable and forgets himself. 

This is why I don‚Äôt think he needs redeeming. He needs understanding. Is Michael ever going to be the kind of person that doesn‚Äôt make jokes when Phyllis get flashed? No. But he is the kind of guy that requires you to notice that before he jokes he is very concerned and sincerely questions if he she ok. That doesn‚Äôt need redeeming. 

Living with Michael requires traits Michael does not possess. He takes things he cannot give but he gives things no one else can

As for the LED headlights, they‚Äôre pretty much inescapable. If you can see them in your rear view, they are likely causing discomfort due to glare.

Mr_Sleep_tight,1598828785,g3es7go,"From a show writer‚Äôs perspective, I think Todd Packer was a character written as a friend of the Michael Scott we saw change. Packer showed up originally before Michael‚Äôs character was re-written to be less David Brent. The problem that caused is after the episode where packer first shows up (Traveling Salesman or Sexual Harassment) Packer can‚Äôt be that different of a character. If he is, what would be the point of having him around if he was just like the other people in the office, but he was Michael‚Äôs friend, but somehow never treated like his friend? The Packer we get throughout the series was the friend of the original Michael Scott who was much more inappropriate and childish.

From a charter perspective, Packer fulfilled Michael‚Äôs fantasies. Packer did the things he wished he could do. Michael lived vicariously through Packer, and because of that didn‚Äôt see his terrible flaws. It was great seeing Holly give Michael the new perspective he needed to see that Packer wasn‚Äôt a good person.",t3_ijmga3,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/ijmga3/question_about_michaels_friendship_with_todd/g3es7go/,3,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-08-30

&gt;‚ÄúYou have to have internal transfer pricing to prove where you earned each piece of the pie,‚Äù Pachter said.

&gt;These types of deals are highly regulated to prevent companies from paying less than market value for a product or service. So NBC had to establish pricing based on similar transactions between unrelated parties. For example, Netflix bought the rights to ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù from¬†WarnerMedia¬†for $100 million for one year.

&gt;Universal Television had to hold an auction for ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù at ‚Äúarm‚Äôs length.‚Äù Meaning, the company could not have any relationship with a potential bidder. This ensures that all parties have equal access to information related to the deal and assures no collusion between the buyer and seller.

[*Looping gif of Michael Scott from TV show ""The Office"". He is standing in a hallway with his hands lightly resting on his hips. The gif begins with him facing slightly to the left with his ear cocked forward, indicating that he is intently listening. The camera zooms closer to his face as he expresses surprise, first by facing toward the camera/speaker, raising his eyebrows and opening his mouth wide. He then opens his mouth very wide with a smile and leans back slightly, before smacking his palms together in a single clap.*]

I think there's like evidence that Creed was always a homeless person. I read a book about The Office and they referenced a few storylines that never came up but creed was homeless for at least parts of the show (""I've never owned a refrigerator before"" etc).

dave8814,1598138658,g2j41a6,"I mean there really are only so many options so I guess the first thing to do is to eliminate the people you can't fire.

The untouchables: 

Jim- One of the top salesman, only person that can realistically be put in charge if I'm out of the office. 

Dwight- Top salesman, vindictive if fired. 

Darryl- When no one is in charge of the warehouse we see what happens. 

Angela- Top accountant. 

Oscar- 2nd best accountant. 

Creed- Apparently the only person in quabity assuance. 

Stanley- Really cornered the African American market.

Kelly- Only person working HR.

Now things drop into the mid tier:

Pam- Can't sell a thing, would likely nag Jim to death if fired.

Phyllis- Really good at selling to people that should have retired 20 years ago, still sells well though. 

Ryan- Not entirely sure he works here, is hot but in a different way.

Now for the bottom tier:

Kevin- likely the least useful person in the office, his mistakes cost the company tens of thousands in overtime, works as the third wheel in a two person department.

Andy- Sells worse than Pam, if we don't fire him now the writers will ruin his character and make us hate two years of the show.

Meredith- Not entirely sure what she does, but we do get free steaks.

Now the Toby tier:

Toby- Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for corporate, so he's really not a part of our family. Also, he's divorced, so he's really not a part of his family.


So in the end I'd fire Toby.",t3_iea7f4,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/iea7f4/you_are_regional_manager_of_dunder_mifflinsabre/g2j41a6/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-08-22

**Holly is being facetious.**

Michael actually does this often as well. My logic is based on the idea that when there are cameras on a person they can't act reserved. Be it a nervous tick, be it a need for attention. So, you have these little moments of playfulness that wouldn't happen if there were no cameras around.

She likely uses SPF, has a very good skincare regime, eats well, exercises, has access to quality healthcare, a rather low stress life... the list goes on and on. Plus when we see her make public appearances  (as well as sometimes on her insta) she has a professional do her makeup and everything is lit a certain way. 

Personally, I think sun damage is the #1 thing that ages people the most! Use a good sunscreen everyday and an eye cream (doesn‚Äôt have to be an expensive one) and moisturize and you‚Äôll be good.

Dwigt was the first to call my attention, his idiotism and Jim's pranks. Then I started to know the other characters and when I realized, 3 years passed of daily watching YouTube videos of The Office until I decided to watch the whole show.

The show can be easily mistaken as shallow from a view of a episode or two, but if you read the lines that build the characters through several seasons, I think it's one of the most consistent shows in its category.",t3_ib2gp3,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/ib2gp3/anyone_else_annoyed_by_people_saying_the_office/g1s6y44/,2,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-08-16

BraveGorkhali,1597359549,g1dr4n0,"PM of Nepal is a communist so he is tanking the economy like all communists do. To save his face, he has resorted to nationalism (ironic I know). He went on to claim COVID coming from Wuhan can easily be suppressed by Nepalese genes because Nepalese are quote **turmeric eating people who breathe air from Himalayas**. He also went on to say the ones from India have spread because India did some kind of genetic mutation thing and sent the virus. So he has also been claiming important events in the Hindu civilization (Nepal is 83% Hindu incase you didn't know) 5000 years ago didn't actually happen in India but rather in Nepal. He claimed Lord Ram(who is believed to be an avatar of Lord Vishnu) was not born in Ayodhya city in India but rather in a small village in Nepal called Ayodhya and married his wife Sita in Nepal. Though there's significant proof for the latter i.e. Sita being born in Janakpur, there's literally no proof that Ram was born in Nepal. What makes it even more absurd is that modern day boundaries didn't exist until 200 years ago. Many empires in Northern region of the subcontinent have occupied territories of both these countries. Mauryans, Guptas, Mallas, Khas, etc have ruled over both Nepal and India. Even Buddha's kingdom spread over southern Nepal and northern Bihar.

So it had become a kinda meme that Nepal owns and can claim all of India.",t1_g1dpifc,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/i91cwp/ed_truck_and_michael_scott_managers_to_the_stars/g1dr4n0/,52,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-08-13

grove4lyf,1597273612,g19odbs,"&gt;He had already shown that he was willing to move on from the situation by moving to Stamford &amp; dating Karen. He frequently attempts to remove himself from uncomfortable situations with her as well (the trip to Australia that never happens, walking away when she starts talking about her wedding, etc.).

Him being willing to move on *but being unable to* is precisely the problem I'm trying to highlight. This longing for Pam has a hold over him that goes beyond the steps he is able to take to address it. He is never able to shake it, no matter what he does. 

&gt;He was already supportive of her aspirations before they even dated, so him turning into some control freak doesn‚Äôt fit.

I was speaking more broadly about him being secure in his relationship, not about him being supportive of Pam's aspirations. 

&gt;He likely doesn‚Äôt remove himself from consideration for the corporate job if he never has the conversation with her at the beach. He has stopped pursuing her by this point &amp; reconciled with his ‚Äúnew‚Äù life.

The very fact that a simple conversation made him turn his whole life around raises a lot of questions, don't you think? He'd moved away; him and Karen had been dating for 6+ months; he himself applied for the corporate position - and he threw that all away based on a conversation, so the ""new"" life was just a sham.

&gt;Katie also starts talking about marriage after a few dates. That‚Äôs more than enough to scare someone off, regardless of his actual reasons for moving on from her.

I agree. But anyone who watches the Booze Cruise episode will be able to pinpoint the exact reason Jim breaks it off with her in the moment. He basically crumbles after Roy and Pam's announcement and takes it out on her. 

&gt;The main difference is that the image he‚Äôs created of Pam is actually Pam, not some fantastical, unattainable version of her that so many people are apt to do in toxic relationships.

Completely agree. He actually knew Pam really well, and I don't think the toxicity in their relationship would've ever risen from that. My point is about how he is obsessed with this idea of wanting to be ""more than friends"" the entire time he knows her. And then, magically knows exactly how to be that, without the prior obsession playing a role in their new dynamic.",t1_g19k33s,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/i8mlul/jim_wouldve_been_a_paranoid_and_obsessive/g19odbs/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-08-12

mytwoquarters,1597186197,g15jehq,"Her ""okay"" was *definitely* meant to be funny tho because Oscar was being over the top enthusiastic about it. Kinda like how when Andy is singing and Jim acts so annoyed and says ""yikes"", it's just played for laughs. 

I didn't like that she didn't tell Jim the gender, that seemed messed up asf. I agree on that one. 


And season 9 is shit because the writers butchered most of the characters. Those wacky out-of-character plots were to try to get ratings and viewers back.

I_Am_From_China__,1596840834,g0qdo7b,"it's funny because cyber security experts have proven time and time again that Tiktoks data mining is no more suspicious than the global standard, it doesn't take less, it doesn't take more. 

even Trumps top cabinet members could only muster up ""Tiktok is *PROBABLY* sending your business and personal information to the Chinese government and military"".

yeah okay, probably sending it to the government, no real evidence, but him adding *Communists Military!!!* at the end is easy to strike fear into people and make people ignore the big ""probably"". 

there's no evidence that tiktok sends its info to China, it collects the same amount of user data as facebook to sell ads. expect Facebook ACTUALLY DID abuse user data in big scandals like cambridge analytics. I don't see bipartisan support on shutting facebook down, or making Microsoft buy facebook.

face it, it's not about the apps safety, it's not about the security risk, it's about Chinas soft political power, the west doesn't want China to be affiliated with good things. why do you think China is connected with ""communist"" in every sentence when it's clearly not. it might be in the name, but it isn't communist. where were the headlines of North Korea and ""Democracy"" together in headlines. that's in its name, is it not?

America has been working hard to shut down Huawei, 5G, Tiktok. probably Tencent's next, who knows which one next. they don't want the west to associate China with good things. watch John Oliver's bit on ""soft power"" if you aren't familiar with the concept. 

tiktok is no more dangerous than Instagram, find me a piece of evidence that shows how tiktok collects more than IG, or Facebook, or YouTube or google and I'll admit I'm wrong. don't give me some article that says ""TIKTOK TRACKS YOUR LOCATION!! SCARY!!!"" when all of them do the same.

and ofc its bipartisan, the west is the west, doesn't matter how which side of the authoritarian right you are on, which be honest the democratic party is just a bit further left, still in the authoritarian right political chart.

and your probably gonna try and use ad hominem on my username, I'm a Canadian biracial person who's lived in Canada all my life, I just happened to make the username bc I thought it was quirky and not aware of how much anti china propaganda was floating around reddit.",t1_g0q2ciu,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/i5b7ya/noooooo/g0qdo7b/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-08-07

Dwight would already have his own suit at the ready, and checking everyone's temperature.

Phyllis would hand out masks that she made herself.

Kevin would sneeze and freak out, only for Oscar to talk to him like a child, and that sneezing doesn't mean anything, but that he should start using tissues whenever necessary.

Angela would have a fit about Kevin as well, but she'd also have to go home to keep Bandit away from everyone.

Meredith would be nonchalant like, ""Well, I probably already got it from Mark... or Randy... or Anthony...""

Kelly would be fine with wearing a mask, because it would make her eyes pop. -OR- Be upset that she'd have to hide her face. -OR- Use this as a means to start a fashion blog over the best makeup to wear with your mask.

Ryan would try to monetize the blog.

Erin would do literally anything Michael told her to with great enthusiasm.

Andy would try to band together with the person he thinks is the smartest or most informed (probably Dwight) and just be the lackey.

cariboucrayons,1596582793,g0dz2yi,"I haven‚Äôt seen them since they first aired.

All I remember is thinking at the time what a chore it was to watch. It‚Äôs like a tale of two different shows.

The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that I was so invested and spent 7 years of my life with these people.. so I stuck it out no matter how difficult.

The new characters weren‚Äôt interesting. Robert California has some moments but I couldn‚Äôt stand Nellie and Andy going full dickhead in Season 9 was too much.

One of the most cringey lines in the history of the show was Jim in the final episode:

‚ÄúBest prank ever.‚Äù

I dunno, it just rung hollow.  It was just.. stupid. I hate it. I also thought Michael‚Äôs forced appearance was totally out of place. 

The whole finale in general was a total letdown.

All of this aside it doesn‚Äôt stop it from being one of my all-time favorite shows. It‚Äôs just I‚Äôve never seen something fall off of a cliff so fast when one of the main characters left.

InferiousX,1596494806,g09lt57,"You keep leaning hard on that ""bad person"" line when *again* the question that was posed was ""why is Karen a *better* person"". 

No one said Pam is Lady Hitler. 

&gt;She also becomes jealous of Pam after Jim reveals his feelings for her.

Oh weird, a coworker who's known your boyfriend longer than you have admits feelings for him and now you don't feel good about it. *Weird*. 

See the thing is that even though Pam did that, Karen still tried to be cordial. Followed by Pam going out of her way to make sure Karen knows that she meant what she said.

I could have sworn I made this way back in like 2014 or 2015 and have had the file on my computer all these years but after digging around for the project file I can't find it.

The only shred of evidence I have is [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/hcSNodT) which shows the creation date of the file as July 6, 2015 which is the same date that the youtube video was uploaded. So it's clear I've had the video all these years, and mine doesn't have the crummy watermark in the top left and weird stuff on the sides (plus it's better quality).

InferiousX,1596496360,g09otwb,"&gt;And why should she lie to protect Karen‚Äôs feelings?

Is that a real question? Why should you not confess your true love to a person who's taken right in front of their significant other? 

&gt; There has to be a point where Karen needs to see the writing on the wall &amp; take some responsibility for herself instead of just letting everything come to her &amp; wanting to be the victim later.

To me there's a level of dissonance that's required to think this way about Karen but not Pam. Let me throw that same argument right back: 

Jim professes his feelings for Pam. Twice. And she shoots him down. He moves on with his life both professionally and romantically. Jim moves back and with his new GF in tow. 

IMO, at this point it's *Pam's* responsibility to be the grown up and let the man she's rejected move on with his life. ""I'm really happy for him!"" 

Except she doesn't. Now that the shoe is on the other foot and Jim has someone to go home too and she's lonely, *then* she reciprocates the feelings for Jim and throws the first wrench in Jim/Karen before it has a chance to fully get off the ground. 

Pam doesn't have to ""lie about her feelings"" but part of being a grown up is knowing when blurting out how you feel isn't appropriate. She hides behind this meek and innocent frame but in some ways, Pam is pretty selfish.",t1_g09mvrs,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/i2wx5t/pam_bad_karen_good/g09otwb/,2,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-08-03

Seahawks1993,1596150916,fzswgvv,"Idea off the top of my head. NBC partners with a popular game franchise for an immersive Office DLC add-on. Story mode starts off with someome from the cast in character doing a talking head. ""So someone approached us with the idea for a video game based on the office...(show clips of a sims like game but with Office characters)....and then Dwight got involved (show completely different game...skyrim esque in epicness). So we settled and did something for everyone."" The end game would be like 10 different genres to please everyone in the office. A genre for each character. Michaels would be nonsensical or really simple. Dwights is an epic rpg. Jims is sports related. Ryans is a about conquering the stock market or something. Kellys is a fashion game or a game about being the most popular girl in high school. Creeds is a gta-esque game but more insane. Kevins game is food based. Stanley is a crossword game but every word is about not working. Merediths is a bartending game. Pams is an art game.

TripleU07,1595890302,fzgdtox,"Jim should have communicated better and not gone behind her back. That said at the start of the season they'd already established they did have a talk and decided not to go along with it. 

I get the feeling Pam wasn't totally understanding of Jim, that he hated his life as paper salesman and all he essentially did was goof around in the office, that he wanted to be something more. Maybe she didn't understand how desperately he needed it. This is probably why she ran out crying when Jim was crowning Dwight as the A.A.R.M, because she realised that she's taken away Jim's potential and put him back to their childish ways from 10 years ago. 

We also had a hint of how that initial preseason off-camera conversation may have gone. If you look at the lottery episode, when they were fantasising about their lives Pam was pretty quick dismiss Jim's fantasies. Yes they were joking around but it shows her psyche. It's possible that initial conversation wasn't much of a conversation and Pam turned down the idea more or less instantly.

The difference between Jim and Pam isn't that one was supporting and the other wasn't. Pam lacked understanding. I think Jim knew that she wouldn't get it so he felt the need to do things behind her back.",t1_fzfhtfa,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hyxiak/chill_pam/fzgdtox/,19,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-27

6 years into marriage, I can see why Pam was indignant - not simply because of the magnitude of change that was asked of her, but more profoundly because Jim made such a life-changing, family-uprooting decision on his own behind her back, even after she expressed her disapproval. This was a dick move on Jim‚Äôs part as a husband, as a life partner, breaking trust on so many different levels.

At least when the conditions were written down, the staff still had some anonymity and confidentiality since Dwight wouldn‚Äôt recognize handwriting and the info was only between each employee and Dwight.

Popcorn_Tony,1595374396,fythj1j,"All the stuff he talked about Jim, the pranks, and the slacking, was kinda like a big focus of the show so I don't know how you can say it wasn't true. The way Michael emphasized that stuff feels wrong because Jim is a sympathetic character and Micheal was leaving out his more positive attributes and Micheal was only doing it because he was scared he was gonna get fired with Jim replacing him. It's part of the humor of the show but Jim's behavior with spending whole days on pranks instead of working totally would not go down in a real work place. Of course neither would Dwight's behavior, or most obviously Michael's, but that's kinda the whole of the show lol.",t1_fyrv9v2,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hv8e1i/the_look_on_jims_face_he_was_genuinely_disgusted/fythj1j/,3,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-21

LaboratoryManiac,1595203013,fylxeuz,"Not sure which half of it you're missing (the *Office* reference or the meme template) so I'll go ahead and explain both for the benefit of anyone who's out of either loop.

**The meme**: There's a meme that's been making the rounds wherein two astronauts are in space. One of them realizes as they look at Earth for the first time from space, that it's not how they expected it to look. (The appearance of the planet varies based on the meme's usage.) The astronaut remarks, ""Wait, it's all [X]?"" The second astronaut replies, ""Always has been"" as he raises a gun to the unsuspecting first astronaut - he knows too much now. He must not be left alive to share his newfound knowledge.

**The *Office* reference**: In one of the cold opens, Jim plays a prank on Dwight by having his Asian friend Steve go to work posing as him. Dwight, of course, recognizes that this person is not Jim, but Jim has covered his bases to keep the ruse up - Steve has been coached on Jim's recent sales, so he can discuss his work performance with Dwight. He has Jim's office voicemail password, and Jim's family photo has been swapped out with one with Pam, Steve, and two Asian babies.",t1_fykvtjz,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hu2bwu/always_has_been/fylxeuz/,19,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-19

During Dwight‚Äôs reign, we really don‚Äôt know enough about what he had planned, justification-wise, when he enters that room with a third cake.

user320name,1595112845,fyi8kkz,"They mentioned a few times that one of the reasons we don‚Äôt follow characters home more is that with some of them we know we‚Äôd just see them eating dinner, watching tv and going to bed unless you wanna throw a curveball like Jim is secretly a drag queen the entire series, but they already have full time curveball characters like Dwight and Creed who are constantly referencing the bizarre aspects of their personal life and those jokes are best served by keeping the details and ‚Äúreality‚Äù a mystery. 

I love Dwight‚Äôs anecdotes about his family and his home life. Actual sequences on Schrute Farms were always underwhelming to me, working too hard at stretching a 1 line joke into a 5 minute joke/sequence that erases the mystery and assumptions we as an audience make.

Now we‚Äôre just in Dwight‚Äôs house and he goes to sleep early and it‚Äôs creepy and lonely. It‚Äôs not this entertainingly zany place. And that‚Äôs because once an often referenced but undefined location comes into play it‚Äôs gonna be difficult to match or top the build up and the lore. And a logistical nightmare to make it as engaging as the cast and location of the Scranton office.

Just look at the unofficial pilot for Schrute Farms, the veritable bottle episode with Thomas Middleditch as his brother. It wasn‚Äôt bad. But it wasn‚Äôt an intentional fully formed fictional universe the way The Office was because it‚Äôs hard to capture an entire existence or world in a bottle episode of a completely different series.

It‚Äôs also why the Joey spin off from Friends didn‚Äôt work. Some characters that steal scenes don‚Äôt necessarily carry series.

They struck gold with Frasier and Better Call Saul. But that‚Äôs rare.

Creed is the same way to me. He‚Äôs way funnier as a monkey wrench in the general proceedings and not as the narrative focus.

Like that Creed episode idea where we follow him wordlessly? To me that‚Äôs way funnier if they are following someone else or if it‚Äôs documentary footage or tv series footage of a separate project in universe and we realize Creed is a part of it or in it doing his crazy stuff nearby within the shot but not the official subject or not related to Dunder-Mifflin.

Like take all the Creed episode ideas- he lives in an abandoned distillery with pet raccoons and he robs liquor stores- and I think they‚Äôd be way funnier revelations as 3 second visual gags behind the scenes of a more conventional episode as opposed to being the main focus.",t3_htgbxx,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/htgbxx/rainn_wilson_pitched_this_creed_concept_episode/fyi8kkz/,3,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-18

FarlynClaes,1595026954,fyerwz5,"If you flip the question, the same could be asked of Pam. Why did she continue to stay engaged to Roy when she knew Jim liked her? And she definitely knew. She was in huge denial on her own part that she also liked him, but was too much of a coward to take that chance. She was comfortable with what she was familiar with, despite Roy being far from the best/ideal partner.

Jim put himself out there twice. In the same night. And exactly like what he told Michael in that hotel room, during the corporate meeting with Jan and the Stamford staff. She told him no, twice. She even tried to brush it off as something HE misunderstood based on their daily interactions, and told him to his face that she still planned to marry Roy after they kissed.

Pet-mousies,1594768695,fy37wyj,"&gt;Doesn't commit to leaving Roy and shuts down Jim's advances twice.

It's a bit unfair to say you hate someone because they didn't know what they wanted in their relationship.

&gt;She wants to be an artist and then she doesn't. She wants to be a salesperson and then she doesn't.

Again, it's common for people to not know what they want in their career. It's very weird to say you hate a character because they don't know what career they're interested in pursuing.

&gt;She says she loves it that Jim bought his parents house for them then turns around and uses it against him when she's already mad at him about other shit.

Pam stifles her honest reactions to things, and that is one of her known shortcomings. The honest reactions tend to come out when she's agitated, so I'll give you that one.

&gt;She doesn't care for Michales intrusion into people's personal lives but then loses her shit and is openly hostile towards him when she finds out he's dating her mother. She should have honestly been fired or reprimanded for that TBH.

It's not exactly intruding into Michael's personal life if it's her *own mother.* I agree, she overreacted, but it's not as if she was unjustly intruding into something that didn't involve her in some capacity.

&gt;She wants to run off to art school to pursue her dream so Jim fully supports her even though it's very hard on him. When its time to return the favor, she gives Jim a rash of shit for a long while until *eventually* turning the corner on it.

When pam ""ran off to art school"" they weren't engaged and had no kids. She also was open that she was doing it and about how long it was going to take. (Not to mention that she eventually gave it up to come home to him)When Jim started in Athlead, he didn't ask if it was ok, and also invested all their savings in a company Pam wanted no part in. She was left to take care of two kids for months on her own.

I'm not trying to be rude. I'm actually loving the debate haha",t1_fy2tmsm,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hqm745/say_that_im_wrong/fy37wyj/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-14

actuallychrisgillen,1594507416,fxrltb2,"I agree, but I find context helps. Prior to tv the main form of entertainment was either theatre or movies. In both cases any time you watched a performance you were surrounded by people.


Then comes tv, with the promise of entertainment in your home. Early shows were basically like early YouTube, stations would throw anything on, vaudeville, singers, comedians, anything to fill the hours. However, both the audience and the performers found it uncomfortable. They had been raised and trained to expect laughs, gasps and groan interspersed throughout a performance. For comedians and comedy it was the worst as every joke felt like a flop with no feedback.


So they added live studio audiences, which brought back the energy and experience that everyone was used to and tv comedies suddenly felt ‚Äònormal‚Äô.


Of course as tv evolved shows went from something filmed live to something that had multiple takes and often would have to stop midway to reset sets and cameras. Live audiences weren‚Äôt as useful as the laughs on take 4 of a 6 hour day weren‚Äôt as energetic, but the need was still there; people still wanted to feel like they were in audience.


Enter the laugh track, originally designed as a supplement to the studio audience it eventually replaced it as the cheaper easier choice. Audiences oth had become used to watching stuff at home, movies like animal house and airplane, which before could only be enjoyed in the theatre, now could watched at home on vhs. People became used to laughing without audience participation and the laugh track became obsolete.

Shows like the Office were the first generation of shows written by the vhs generation. A generation that has learned to laugh alone so now the norms have flipped on their heads and it‚Äôs the laugh track that feels weird.",t1_fxohp7p,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hpaurd/a_surprise_to_be_sure_but_a_welcome_one/fxrltb2/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-11

DHMC-Reddit,1594508240,fxrp1nf,"The Office from the beginning was always a mockumentary. The creators of the Office then later created Parks and Rec. Parks and Rec is also not a mockumentary.

They tried to do it as a mockumentary like the Office at first but it didn't work, so they changed it. Parks and Rec never really became its own thing until it stopped being a mockumentary.

That happened around season 3. Go watch Parks and Recs again. You'll notice how, over time, the interviews become less and less frequent until it's not like a fake documentary, more of a good comedy show that doesn't use laugh tracks.",t1_fxrhxrq,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hpaurd/a_surprise_to_be_sure_but_a_welcome_one/fxrp1nf/,4,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-11

But I believe that the people who make these decisions at TV networks are taking their cues from the most sensitive, angry subset of the population due to how vocal they are. I think a lot of people think that everyone is like that now. 

If the Office fades into history it will be because it's off of Netflix soon and with all of the streaming services I just don't see a ton of people subscribing to a service that just streams NBC stuff. True fans will buy the series on itunes or amazon or something, but the new generation coming up won't discover it as easily once it's off of netflix.",t1_fxn8p5n,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hovm9g/sad_but_true_esp_the_early_season_stuff_where/fxrpgbf/,2,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-11

On the other hand, even if Darryl or Phyllis weren't that important for the office productivity, Dwight didn't get what he asked for. Cathy was still there, in an operation that was considered relevant. We get afterwards the explanation that Robert California thinks of the saber stores as something weak in terms of the technological products that the company sells. The project was destined to fail, so why did he take Dwight down to Florida?

TexehCtpaxa,1594249319,fxd5p2n,"This isn't just people with anxiety. It's everyone. The same as wanting to go to the same restaurants and not new ones. Hanging out with the same people, not new ones. People just like what's familiar. People who are anxious stick to routines and similar things more than average I suppose, but in general, this doesn't strictly apply to just anxious people. 

So yes, you're excused. Unless your bowels fill with water as a reaction to known or unknown stimulus. The sensation is very similar to the ""stomach dropping"" feeling like on a rollercoaster or going over a speed bump. Then you're experiencing the sort if anxiety that makes people like me follow nearly identical routines everyday so as to avoid random stimulus that creates that awful feeling. A friend unexpectedly texting me asking to hang out is pretty traumatic for me. 

Sorry I was really anxious and this helped me vent. I gotta go to work again, for an unusual shift in like 5 minutes. Normally I just delete it after typing the comment, and just say some office quote.

HapaMari,1594164332,fx9b2is,"His facial expression is saying, ""*talks* isn't the right word for it...""

Like, they're definitely not conversations, because that denotes that they're pleasant, mutual, and welcomed. They're not exactly arguments, because there's not much to argue: he shouldn't be in a relationship while being in love with someone else. He's in the wrong. He doesn't want to say he's being lectured, because it's kind of rude to Karen, and he probably has a lot of 'splainin to do. And he's probably not entirely a willing participant in the ""talks,"" but he can't really say anything about it (to her) because he's so clearly in the wrong.

I'm imagining some variation of, ""Let's talk about our feelings. Well how do you feel about me? How do you feel about Pam? How long did you feel that way? So you don't feel that way anymore? Are you sure? Well, this is how I feel. I moved here for you.""

Basically, take all the anxiety someone would feel if their partner was in love with someone else, roll it up, and compound it with Karen's slight neuroses.

Karen doesn't want to break up, but she's not sure if that's where it's headed, she's trying to figure out what Jim's thinking but he's kind of in denial, she wants to try to ensure his feelings for her but isn't convinced, etc.",t1_fx96yzb,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hn4mus/are_jim_karens_talks_actually_sex/fx9b2is/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-07

MsChenandlerBong_,1594076442,fx5dk1m,"People really will hate on Pam for any reasons, huh? This moment was to highlight both Pam's loneliness and the degree to which Michael cares about his employees. The latter statement is obvious, but the former's impact can't be understated. 

Pam, at that point, had lost her best friend, Jim, and was realizing that Roy couldn't fulfill her needs and was selfish. The office had often been painted as a place for people to be friendly, and I think even in the real world it's not absurd to ask coworkers, if you're acquaintances, to come to an art show or something similar. She was sad because she reached out, and until Michael, the only coworker who came criticized her art and attacked her person. She felt lonely and  she put pride and her character in her art.

ghoulbug,1593991579,fx1onqh,"That makes sense. I think there‚Äôs a lot of cultural shorthand being used‚Äî to the UK audience, they‚Äôd immediately recognize characters like David Brent and Gareth, know people like that irl, and be immediately laughing at/rooting against them. David is immediately insufferable to the UK audience, Gareth is immediately a complete weirdo. Dawn is cute and likeable, but her relationship with her shitty fianc√© seems absolutely hopeless, and you never really get the impression Tim actually has a chance with her‚Äî it‚Äôs just way more of a ‚Äúwell that sucks‚Äù kind of joke.

When I watched at first, I missed a lot of that shorthand (it didn‚Äôt help that I didn‚Äôt process like 25% of what they were mumbling) and didn‚Äôt catch how cynical and unforgiving their characterization is right from the start. Adapting the show for a US audience really involved both making the characters more redeemable, but also making the characters we‚Äôre (at least at first) meant to dislike more recognizable to us‚Äî because we may not have met many Gareths in the US, but we definitely know a Dwight or two.",t1_fwzjy9x,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hlkdb1/should_i_continue_watching_uks_the_office/fx1onqh/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-05

kalvinc2113,1593816817,fwumyll,"Its a ""regional"" paper company, NYC and the surrounding area is their ""region"". Robert Mifflin met Robert Dunder at Dartmouth University, which is in New Hampshire, so let's assume after college they went to the nearest metropolitan are to start their business, which would be NYC. This would explain why corporate is in NYC, also let's not that no paper is sold out of NYC, it's just a collection of offices for executives and corporate level departments. Also keep om mind, New York state is huge. Its most likely that when they started to expand, they expanded within their own state. You can assume this for a couple reasons: 1. There are the most branches in NY (Albany, Utica, Buffalo, Syracuse, and i think there may be one more); 2. Its easier to expand within your own state because of state laws, taxes, etc wont change, once you start expanding into other states you have to start worrying about whole new sets of regulations. But eventually they got big enough to expand out of NY state and opened branches Nashua, New Hampshire, Stamford, Connecticut, and of course Scranton, Pennsylvania, and i belive at the company picnic we may have seen a branch from Maine. Thats why the majority of branches are in NY and closer to NYC where corporate is, is the expand into Florida or Tennessee, it would be really difficult for corporate to keep up with what's going on. We even.see this a bit with Gabe and Robert California travelling back and forth to Tallahassee all the time, it can work, but its not sustainable. Usually with large national companies IRL, they will have corporate offices in different regions to help control the sprawl, Dunder Mifflin was never really big enough for that",t3_hksfnl,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hksfnl/why_are_there_so_many_dunder_mifflin_branches_in/fwumyll/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-03

Season 9

A humbled and changed Roy resurfaces in ""Roy's Wedding"" when he invites Jim and Pam to his wedding among other Dunder-Mifflin staffers in attendance. Despite their original expectations of Roy, the couple are shocked to find out that Roy has changed for the better. He is now the owner of a successful gravel company he created, evident by the $50,000 sports car and the nice house that he owns and the elegant and tasteful wedding. Roy later thanks Jim before the ceremony, crediting his breakup with Pam to make way for meeting his future bride. Pam is also stunned to see that Roy can play the piano as he sings a song to his bride.

But if it doesn‚Äôt effect me I try not to care. She does go on to admit she feels bad looking back on how she suppressed her feeling for Jim. But that‚Äôs a huge problem I take issue with in human nature in general. It causes so much drama and unnecessary issues in life when people take the easy way instead of taking a more befitting life path, even if it might be less comfortable or a bit painful.

Gay men were seen to be feminine and not at all manly. Beards (the hair on your face) were seen as masculine. Someone that was tough and masculine couldn't be gay. So if someone had a beard (hair on face) they couldn't be gay. Dating or pretending to date a woman to cover up being gay is almost like growing a beard (hair on face) as they may serve the same purpose with dating/pretending to date being way more convincing.",t1_fwiw9ma,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hitb1d/a_beard_makes_all_the_difference/fwj0wdd/,5,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-06-30
