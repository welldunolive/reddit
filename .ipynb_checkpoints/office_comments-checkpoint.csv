It’s just that in the early episodes Jenna is *extremely* condescending and rude towards Angela in a way that is hard to ignore. She gets better about it after a few episodes, but it’s hard not to hear Jenna holding herself back from the barbs she wants to throw, if that makes sense. It sounds like she heard the negative feedback about her attitude and is trying hard not to be that way, but “that way” is just her natural self. Watching the office now feels like watching Jenna instead of Pam, bc I guess I let it get to me too much. 

That being said, the podcast still has a ton of great nuggets. It’s just that the Pam character is ruined for me now.",t1_g0v90ad,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/i6ek21/i_wish_i_could_go_back_to_the_time_before_i_heard/g0v9hls/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-08-09

I LOVE the whole Michael Scott Paper Company arc but it was so short lived. I think it would’ve been funny if the “buy out” of the MSPC is what drove Dunder Mifflin to bankruptcy. 

IMO, Holly should’ve stuck around and season 6 should’ve been the last. Season 6 could’ve opened with Jim and Pam’s wedding and the series finale is Holly and Michael’s wedding/documentary panel. Then it’s shown briefly or implied that Jim and Pam have a baby and Dwight and Angela are back together.

767,NYIJY22,1595223103,fyms0l6,"Yeah I agree. I think the biggest thing with Scott's Tots is that the whole episode is built around the big cringeworthy moment.

The central plot of the episode is that Michael made this huge mistake and has to handle it.

I actually think there are a ton of moments and little plot lines I find more cringeworthy.

Phyllis' wedding, Michael and Dwight lifting pepperoni Tony onto the table, Holly thinking Kevin is retarded, Toby touching Pam's leg, Michael proposing to Carol, Michael's entire involvement with Pam's mom.

I could go on and on about moments I find cringier.

There's also episodes that I think are built around cringier topics than Scott's Tots. Gay Witch Hunt, The Dinner Party, and even Did I Stutter were worse for me.

Maybe it's because I just find the Scott's Tots situation to be less realistic or relatable? I feel like everyone's either been to or hosted an event that's made them uncomfortable. And many people deal with situations where someone doesn't know how to react to a gay person coming out, or deal with an awkward confrontation at work.

I just can't envision anyone ever being in a situation like Scott's Tots. From how many years in advance he made the promise, to not dealing with it way earlier, to even showing up in person in the first place. It's just too many hoops to jump through to put myself in his shoes, so it doesn't bother me as much.",t1_fymlt5z,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hu9t3t/wheres_this_scene_lmao/fyms0l6/,11,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-07-20

So excited to hear about your new show! You and the rest of the cast of The Office have put so much laughter and joy into my life, so thank you for that. 

A question or two, hopefully these aren’t repeat questions (I did go through the comments but there are a ton of them). 

1.) Were there any other actors that you connected with especially well while working on The Office? My assumption is probably Phyllis, but was there anyone else? (By the way, Stanley and Phyllis’ relationship is my favorite in the whole show. You guys were amazing). 

2.) Did having a film crew being filmed by another film crew add any fun drama?

[Also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Benihana_Christmas#Production):

The actresses who played the women that Andy and Michael bring back to the office were different from the actresses who played the waitresses in the Benihana restaurant. According to the show's prop master, this was because Andy and Michael failed to pick up the original waitresses, and settled for ""less attractive ones"".

However, at Paley Fest 2007, Greg Daniels admitted that the women they cast were ""too good-looking"", which led to the joke failing since the original script specifically called for Andy and Michael's dates to be unattractive.",t1_fwfze80,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hi9knj/watching_this_episode_again_and_just_realized_the/fwg1pef/,1,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-06-30

About half a year or so later I get phone calls saying I owe the apartment complex 15k. Of course I was freaking out so I called back to see wtf was going on. Apparently she had stopped paying rent and got evicted. The amount of damages and unpaid rent totalled up to 15k because they had to replace all the carpet and part of the wall. The only names on the lease were mine and the chicks and she ended up disappearing so they went after me. I refused to pay because fuck that and ended up having terrible credit.

1200,ghoulbug,1590900630,fse5ba5,"Honestly I would watch those episodes again if I were you. I don't really see anything that Jim was ""cost"" in that situation, either financial and emotional. He didn't lose money *or* time.  (At least— he didn't lose money that the company itself wasn't bleeding on its own - nothing to do with Pam. People also forget that a lot of the fear Pam had with Athleap had to do with how close the company was to failing at all times.) Nor did he even stop working there until Jim himself actually agreed to stop. There was a good long time where Pam was upset with the back and forth but Jim still was 100% free to pursue it, even to their family's detriment. 

Jim's show-long flaw was that he was bad at communicating before (ath)leaping (lol) into something. He let his frustration and his ennui build up un-talked about for seasons and seasons until he had to (in a desperate Hail Mary) finally DO SOMETHING about it, and it was almost always not well thought-through ""something."" Through his disagreement with Pam, he rediscovered the things he values most in life, and he learned to communicate better. He quit working at Athleap in order to develop himself and his communication skills with his family, because he *wanted* to.

On the other hand, Pam's flaw is that she doesn't (ath)leap *enough*. She doesn't take any risks, she plays it too safe - and she hurts herself and her family in the process by holding herself back from something that could possibly make her even happier and more fulfilled. Jim and Pam *both* make each other better people when they meet in the middle. Jim learns to be more cautious, and Pam learns to join him in taking cautious risks.

And I can see all this while not even being that big a fan of either Pam or Jim lmao",t1_fse3npp,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/gtscgw/office/fse5ba5/,3,DunderMifflin,comment,2020-05-31

S9 did a decent job of wrapping up stories for some former characters and is not without some charm. But the first half was dominated by ramping up Dwight’s character for a spinoff. Then when plans for the spinoff got cancelled, they changed course and rewrote a few major arcs. It feels unbalanced.

**Person**: What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.

**OP**: I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.

**Person**: So now we have babies right

**OP**: Yupp. That's how this works

**Person**: Great I'll be in the warehouse

**OP**: It will be the best 19 minutes and 48 seconds of your life

For the love of god, PLEASE stop posting the same Coronavirus/COVID-19 memes over and over

I have removed [this image](https://i.imgur.com/ApB3oag.png) at least 40 times since the news of Coronavirus began and I can't imagine how many times we've removed it as a whole team.

It's not original. You're not a genius. It's incredible low effort and it blows my mind that you think you're the first person to post it in relation to this global pandemic. Same applies to ""Shut up about the virus"" Gabe memes and ""Coronavirus? Isn't that just a fancy word for having the flu"" Dwight memes.

Don't bother, your post will just be removed and it'll waste your time and our time too.

Thank you!
