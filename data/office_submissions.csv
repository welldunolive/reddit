10 reason I can’t stand Pam Beesley,"I can’t stand Pam “Beasley” from the Office. 

I’ve been watching the office and I can’t stand Pam. I give Pam chance until the end of series to make me go oh she’s not so bad, but no, I can’t stand her even when curtains fall. Other than giving emotional support to others, She’s just a little girl, so annoying to me and here’s why: 

First, She leads guys on but acts innocent!
She engaged to Roy who she doesn’t really like but never tell him. Like come on, I know Roy isn’t the best boy friend for you but you gotta tell or dumped him instead of flirting with Jim who you clearly knows you’re into each other while making Roy clueless! It’s emotional cheating and Roy trusted you! 

When Jim dated someone else, she also let Toby showers her with affection. Come on Pam, how hard it is for you to tell Toby you’re into somebody or something? 

Second, she’s all about “honesty” but lies in multiple occasion. For example She scams the company to be a position that doesn’t exist. 

Third, she quits for everything and Play the victim. Nobody force you to go to art school, nobody force you to quit your job and join Michael company, and nobody for sure never force you to be a salesman! And guess what she still does and play the victim when something goes bad. 
I mean when she was in Michael company, she wasn’t a good salesman, guess what she did? Goes to her old job trying to get her back! Like come on Pam. Make up your mind and own your own decision! 

Forth, She doesn’t support Jim and Michael if it doesn’t benefit her! 

Michael has been the only one who support Pam arts and in multiple occasion trying to help Pam. What does Pam gives him back? So little support when Michael dated her mom. Constantly complain about Michael. Almost cross Michael by trying to leave his company when he needs her. 

Jim, a great husband always listen to Pam. Guess what she did? The only time Jim finally has a dream and pursue it, she decided not to support it when it’s inconvenient. Passive aggressive about investment Jim clearly has talked to Pam before going to invest and already apologize for not telling her he agreed. Complaining about possibility to move to Philadelphia and has to take care of children on her own when Jim is chasing her dream which by the way, it would helps them get financial freedom if he succeed. 
Oh let’s not forget how he’s happy when Darryl thought he didn’t get job in Jim company. Like I’m sorry if you want ordinary life full of misery but don’t bring Jim and children to this. 

Fifth she’s all about image. There are multiple occasion Pam holding back from telling the truth and let others take the fall. For example when Meredith got lice and everyone blames her, in fact it was Pam’s fault. Guess what she did? Stay silent and let Meredith takes the fall. 

Sixth. She’s always need help and somehow makes others think of solution. When her mural got broke down, she called a fake meeting and doesn’t even have an actual plan. Like come on Pam, everyone else has to plan the revenge for you? Oh Irrelevant but don’t forget in that Episode Pam gets the camera crew fired for protecting her ass who can’t stand up for herself. 

Eight, shes a bad partner. In season 9, again she repeats the pattern on season 1 where shes avoiding talking to their partner and consoles to other men instead. In this case, she console to the cameramen. She has nerve to ask Jim “what’s the matter?”. You Pam is the matter! 

Then, on later episode, Pam consoles to cameramen once again asking if Jim has changed just because he’s into work. He’s chasing a dream in a startup! What do you think it’s gonna be? He works 9 to 5 and has a lot of time to fill your selfish little girl need? Don’t forget he also has make time for children too. Gosh Pam. She also makes it seem like she’s perfect in couple therapy. I don’t know if Jim deserves all of this 

Nine, she indecisive but annoyed when someone else makes decision for her. When she finally makes decision that’s holding Jim back to pursue his dream, she’s the one who needs to be consoled! Jim is the one who has to assure her! Are you being serious right now? You take Jim away from his dream and you’re the one complaining? Afraid he’s going to resent you in years from now? Hell if Jim going to resent Pam, it’s his right! You did force him into giving it up. 

Ten, the only thing that Pam says learn from documentary is how much she’s stalling. Really Pam? That’s all you learn? How about appreciate someone? Stand up for yourself? How Jim actually loves you? 

And let me tell you, the way she sold house in the finale so Jim can pursue his dream is not fast enough. You need strangers to come up to you and make you see how selfish you are? Thanks to Pam, maybe,
Just maybe, Jim can’t even join athlead anymore cause it’s too late. Have she ever thought of that?",DunderMifflin,1601296122,findinganswer123,6,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/j1b2bj/10_reason_i_cant_stand_pam_beesley/,1,True,submission,2020-09-28

Leave Pam alone!! *SPOILERS*,"I see so much hate for Pam on this subreddit and it is completely unjust. The main problem people have with her is that she failed to support Jim in his dreams at Athlead.

Jim and Pam are in a marriage, a partnership. Jim went behind Pam's back to take this job offer. This is after their talking head where they said they Both talked about it and decided it wasn't the best time. Jim decided on his own without any warning to Pam, his life partner, that he needed to do this. 

And that could have been fine. Before admitting to Pam what he has done Jim talks with Daryl and in that conversation he says he could still commute to Philly. But that's not what happens, instead he moves to Philly part time, effectively leaving All home responsibilities on Pam. 

Pam in the meantime is realing over the fact that Jim pretty much lied to her. An immedite response in that situation could very well be a fearful one, If he's willing to go to this extent than I have to go along or lose him. I have to agree. 

A point people like to bring up is that Jim was supportive of Pam going to New York for school. This isn't even a good argument however. Pam's program was 3 months. And even if she had stayed to redo it, it was another 3 months. Also they were not married or had any children. Jim had no deadline at all. Which Toby pointed out when Jim told him about couples therapy. Pam is holding the burden of 2 kids and a house without the help of her partner and there is no end in sight. 


So Pam finds herself in a situation she never asked for and felt forced into choosing. And then she realizes that the endgame of this results in their family moving to Philadelphia. Not because of a decision discussed as equal partners but because of Jim's decision. 

I honestly believe that if Jim had gone to Pam and told her he felt passionately about pursuing this than she would have supported him. But instead he started off the whole venture on a very negative note, which started a wedge in the partnership and left Pam holding the short end of the stick. Jim even points out at one of his first meetings that he has to play it cool with Pam because how would he feel if the situation was reversed. 

And of course Pam isn't going to want to move after dealing with all if that. Moving is hard! And moving with kids is even harder! She was already physicially and emotionally exhausted, yet people think it should be easy for her to abandon her hometown and life for something she didn't have a say in. 

Everyone also seems to forget that ultimately, at the end of the series, Pam does come around and they move to Austin where the new headquaters for newly named Athleap is. Because they worked on their marriage and Pam felt secure again, and this time she was part of the decision. 

Obviously Pam isn't perfect. Nobody in the cast, or the world, is. But I am so sick of seeing everyone hold Jim up like some kind of saint who is a victim to his shrew of a wife. His career doesn't take precedence over their marriage and family. Jim screwed up here, and Pam's reaction was both justified and human.",DunderMifflin,1600437707,filthymormon,13,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/iv6mal/leave_pam_alone_spoilers/,14,True,submission,2020-09-18

"Since we all love to talk about our PTSD with Scott’s Tots, here’s my story","When I first watched the show, I pirated it on this app for my phone. I would have to download episodes onto my phone with barely any space, and transfer them to my computer. I watched the show this way, no problem. When I decided to rewatch the show, I graduated to a better pirating service. Everything is going smoothly until I get an episode that doesn’t look familiar. *Oh my god! I’ve found a missing episode*, I thought. I was going to pay EXTRA attention to this godsend. 

Annnnnnd what episode do you think it was? In the entire show, somehow Scott’s Tots was the only episode I had skipped. I don’t know if it was the pirating service, or I made a mistake and somehow forgot to transfer it to my computer.

Minor nitpick,"Was rewatching The Injury and I noticed something interesting. Michael calls the office and we can hear him talking to Pam on the handset. It’s the only time we can hear the other end of a phone conversation on the office phone if not on speaker. The same thing happens when Pam is at Pratt and her and Jim are on the phone all day, you can hear both ends on the conversation (though in that episode they at least make it look like they synched the footage and audio from both sides of the call). As I said, a small nitpick, but like the things pointed out by others (somehow Michael was lost even though the Doc crew was with him, the doc crew telling Pam about Dwight eating the candy bar Angela bought, somehow someone from the doc crew was able to get to Utica with Jim, Dwight, and Michael but no one was with Jim, Dwight, and Michael) there are moments that really bend the reality of a “documentary”.",DunderMifflin,1599582362,Mr_Sleep_tight,1,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/iowqda/minor_nitpick/,1,True,submission,2020-09-08

"What's the name of the song that plays when Dwight says ""You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.""?","There's a song that plays during this part that sounds like classical or opera music. I've tried to figure out what song it is for a while now. The only answers I've seen are O Fortuna and Dies Irae, and I'm pretty sure neither of these are correct. I've wondered what the song is ever since I first saw the episode and it's one of those unsolved Office mysteries that's always really bothered me. Could anyone help out?

Just finished the office for the first time,"And wow, they really should have let it end at season 8 in my opinion. Season 9 had some decent moments but overall it just seemed to frustrate me with character choices and additions, the boom mic guy was not needed and was only there to just have us viewers a tad worried about jim and pam, Andy turned into a terrible person early in the season which was such a huge difference compared to him in season 8, the interns in general i wasn’t a fan of at all they just seemed to be in the way. Erin dropping Andy and immediately taking peter was one of the biggest ‘why?’ moments of the show for me and that to me is the reason why i never really like peter. 

Season 8 would have been a good place to end it, Robert California wasn’t in Michael’s shadow anymore he felt like his own character that was amusing to watch whenever he came on screen (favourite moment is when he changed his name when he met David Wallace.

Matching colour schemes in The Office,"Not sure if people mentioned before, but I found a colour scheme match in ""broke"" season 5

This is respect to a previous post that found congruence in colour schemes during the ""Dinner Party"" episode (Michael was blue while Jan was red). Also, this planned colour coding was often mentioned in the office ladies podcast.  

In the episode: ""Broke"" season 5, when David, Jim, Dwight, and Charles were in the conference room, Jim and David were wearing blue shaded tops and ties that match, while Dwight and Charles were wearing pale yellow shaded tops and ties. This matching seems to signify the matching ideas in pushing for a resolution with Michael Scott.

"Question about 3.17, “Business School”!","Hi fellow Office Fans!

I have a question, more like a general wonderment, about Season 3’s 17th episode, “Business School”

So basically when Micheal says “David will always beat Goliath”, a student in the audience says “But there’s five goliaths— Staples, OfficeMax-“, and then he is cut off by Micheal. 

So my question is, and this has gotten to a point where i think about it daily, what other office supply focused super stores are there? I know it’s a stupid question but, like, whenever an office member mentions one of the “big guys” who may run them out of business, they always reference one of these two.

I might be over thinking this a little.

I didn't like Jim and Pam,"Before you downvote, I ask of you one favor: Only downvote if you think I didn't make a good enough case for my opinion. Don't downvote only because you disagree. And I have a lot of reasons for this opinion, so please hear me out. I know Jim and Pam were the central couple on this amazing show, but now when I rewatch it, the fact that they just really aren't good sticks out to me. Upon first viewing, I was basically indifferent. They were fine, and I had absolutely no problem watching them. But when I watch other shows and see other couples, I kind of realize that the writing for them is awful. See, these two characters are normal. They are the most normal people you will find on this show. That isn't a good recipe for a sitcom couple. But there are still ways to handle a normal couple in a comedy. I've seen other shows do it all the time. The way the writers of The Office handled it isn't good. They decided to change the relationship at every possible moment. They couldn't have Jim and Pam just settle down for a season because it was easier to write for them in the way that they did. Let me lay out their relationship across each season:

&amp;#x200B;

**Seasons 1-3: Will they/won't they**

This was actually handled really well. While you could make the case it was a little stretched out at times, I feel like it held up as an ongoing plot. 

**Season 4: Dating**

OK, for this one, it isn't too bad, but I feel like we have recognize the fact that they added a ""will they get engaged"" plot towards the end. It ended up taking over their relationship for the end of Season 4. I feel like this might be when the writers realized they didn't have much to do with their couple. 

**Season 5: Engagement/Apartness**

Another one that isn't egregious, Season 5's engagement plot was sweet. But they had to keep Jim and Pam in other states in order to keep them going. The whole art school thing was fine, but they threw in unnecessary problems while they were apart. Once she returned, other plots took over and there wasn't room for growth in their relationship.

**Season 6: Marriage/Child**

Season 6, on the other hand, is really bad. Season 5 set up two plots for Season 6 that had to happen, or else people would realize that Jim and Pam weren't working. The wedding was fine, but it was the whole having a kid thing that pushed me over the edge. I get that couples have kids, but after this point, there was rarely a Jim and Pam moment that didn't center around their parenthood. 

**Season 7: Parenthood**

Same thing I said for Season 6. Here's the thing: this is a show about a workplace and the people in it. The parenthood leaked into their couple way too much. Honestly, there are a lot of ways to handle them having kids, but making it take over their relationship was too much. It's not a good watch. 

**Season 8: Second Kid**

Because the one kid that took over their couple wasn't enough! They added a second one for two reasons: a rivalry between Angela and Pam and a new child for the Halperts to have leak into the workplace too much. But nobody cares about Season 8 so it doesn't really matter. 

**Season 9: Marital Problems**

This is the worst one. Hear me out. I know couples have issues in real life. But this was the couple that so many had come to love. You can give them problems, but do little fights as it goes on. Reference behind the scenes stuff. But giving the couple season long marital problems and having it dominate the plot just wasn't a good decision. Their ending didn't even make up for it. This was clearly the Hail Mary attempt by the writers to give the couple something to do for the final season. And it just doesn't work out. 

&amp;#x200B;

So as you can see, the writers were jerking the viewer around basically every season once they started dating and refused to let them settle down. It is fine for a first viewing, but frustrating on rewatches. And the worst part is that this doesn't have to happen. Look at Leslie and Ben from Parks and Rec. The writers didn't try to add a change in their relationship at every moment, they let it play itself out. That was the way The Office should've handled it. So, downvote if you think the case I made was awful and missed the mark, but, if I changed your view even a little bit, please upvote.

You are a grown man, who isn’t dieting, or 4 years old. Also, you deserve to bite your cheek that much and go home in pain if you keep eating baby carrots after 30!!!

Better Spinoff ideas than Uncle Stan,"As many of you will know Leslie David Baker is trying to create a Stanley Hudson spinoff. The premise- a retired Stanley moves to LA to help his widowed Nephew with his motorcycle/flower shop. So here are some alternative Office spinoff ideas.

Taking the leap. Jim and Darryl running a startup in Texas. Show could also focus on Jim and Pam’s family in Texas.

The Farm. The actual spinoff attempt. Would have focused on Dwight and his family running a farm. While the spinoff was never made it still had a stronger premise than Uncle Stan.

A Spinoff focusing on Dwight as manager leading a whole new group of Dunder Mifflin employee’s. You could have the original characters show up now and again.

A Spinoff focusing half on Oscar’s political career and half on Kevin’s bar. Chuck in Meredith for good measure.

A Spinoff about Andy as head of admissions at Cornell. Have Erin as a student.

A Spinoff exclusively about the warehouse. You already got Nate what more do you need?

Creed shorts. 5 minute stories about Creed.

so obviously we know the melodica part plays 3 times in the song. during the second note of the third time it plays, you can hear the organ doing a little part of the piano part. 

here is where you can hear the whistling:

in that same part of the song, (3rd time the melodica part plays), its at the very end of it right before that little end part where the sign that says “the office” shows up on screen.

Andy was always an annoying, whiny, ragey, awkward character that bothered me in a lot of aspects, and i don’t think he deserved the position in the first place. yes her character was severely annoying and unlikeable until they gave her the bad ex dimension and things went uphill, but i love her character form then on and i acyually love that she took andy’s job.",DunderMifflin,1594363869,anonshxt,5,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hok7w7/unpopular_opinion_about_nellie/,1,True,submission,2020-07-10

Trying to remember a scene/joke…,"Hi all,

Sorry for how vague this post is going to be!

I'm sure I watched an episode of The Office years ago where one of the characters mentioned the favourite joke of someone else – I think it was during a talking heads scene.

It was a very short joke e.g. *""Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side""*, except it was actually funny.

I was quite sure it was Michael telling the interviewer what Dwight's favourite joke is, but I've tried so hard to find it without any luck so maybe it was a different character...

My personal thoughts on Clark and Pete,"Originally I thought they were just lazy add ons but once they were in the show more often, I came to love their characters
Pete- my least favorite of the two, got Erin away from Andy, I like Andy’s character but they really butchered him in the final 2 seasons, but he really made Erin happy, their scenes together were funny, I think he has good chemistry with the rest of the office but I think he should have been added earlier, like season 3-4, I don’t dislike Pete but prefer Clark
Clark- my favorite of the two by far, I think his character is hilarious, he is really well written and has good scenes with everyone, he is childish unlike Pete and isn’t taking everything to seriously, i believe people only dislike the two because they were added so late, which fair enough, they were added really late but people would have loved them if they came earlier in my opinion, Clark happens to be my favorite character even though he wasn’t too popular 
I’m expecting hate since nobody likes these two but so be it, I think these characters are really well writen",DunderMifflin,1594374253,TheSmiley420,4,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hom3b5/my_personal_thoughts_on_clark_and_pete/,1,True,submission,2020-07-10

Just finished watching The Office.,"So for the last 2 months I'd been watching the series and what can I say, I still think of it in my head as a documentary. I've been working at corporate for the past 3 years, couldn't have a choosen better time to watch this show. 

It's hard to choose a favourite character, although I tend to go with Dwight. I really liked the show until there was Michael Scott, later although the quality degraded for a couple of seasons, I think they pulled off a great last 7 episodes. You could see that this is going to end and you couldn't expect to have fun but to cherish whatever you've seen so far. It was only two months for me, but I think folks who have watched it over years must've felt a really great connection towards the end. 

I just envy the relationship of Pam and Jim, Period. It was so heartwarming to see Michael as Dwight's best man. 

I can't go about all the best moments of watching 201 episodes in a single post.

"We all know that The Office is largely timeless, but let's list some things in the show that haven't aged so well.","So far in my re-watch, here's what stuck out to me:

- The dance scene at Jim and Pam's wedding. My first reaction to it is that it totally destroys any suspension of disbelief. It became even worse when I realized that it was based on some old-ass forgotten viral YouTube video which was old even at the time the episode aired, and the fact that it has that old-ass, forgotten, earbleed-inducing music blaring throughout makes it even worse.

- I had several different bullet points for where the jokes about Michael's insensitivity went too far, but I decided to condense it all into one. I think we all know what I'm talking about: any time he sexually harassed someone(particularly his employees), the tranny clause line, some of the more uncomfortably racist things like his Chinese impression or that racist Indian bit with Kelly in Diversity Day, so on and so forth. For the most part I think the whole ""tries to be aware but fails miserably"" shtick still holds up, but those aforementioned instances... don't. I'd also say him calling Oscar ""faggy"" holds up pretty poorly; yeah, it's about him realizing that it was wrong, but that word has come to be recognized as a pretty serious slur in the interim. That's almost like Michael Scott full-stop calling a black dude the n-word. Never mind that he forces himself on Oscar.

- I've seen people make observations like ""they have flip phones in The Office, that didn't age well"". Fuck that. It's not a big deal if we see characters talk into flip phones occasionally. On the other hand, I DO think that Christmas episode with the iPod aged terribly, given how big a deal was made about it being this incredible, uber-expensive, top-of-the-line gift.",DunderMifflin,1594391296,ClaudeFrollo1986,32,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hopw5x/we_all_know_that_the_office_is_largely_timeless/,1,True,submission,2020-07-10

Notes on Rewatching the Office.,"Notes on rewatching The Office

&amp;#x200B;

Season 1: I know it's hard but you must watch this season when rewatching because it makes Jim and Pam's relationship so much better in the later seasons. In a weird way, it makes Season 2 more rewarding for me.

Season 2: This season is all pretty good but the only one that stands out as skippable is S02E19 'Michael's birthday.' 

Season 3: This is one of the best seasons but, there are two episodes that I end up skipping. Them being S03E09 'The Convict' and S03E16 'Phyllis' Wedding'.

Season 4: No complaints, this is considered by a lot to be the best season of The Office and I can see why.

Season 5: Again, none of this I would consider skippable.

Season 6: Two Episodes. First, EP 14 'The Banker'. Boring clip episode. Secondly, EP 12 'Scott's Tots' both plots in this episode are awful and cringe. If I could only skip one episode in the entire show, it would be this one.

Season 7: There are a couple of bad ones this time around. EP 03 'Andy's Play' boring and mediocre. EP 07 'Christing' Both plots are bad and unfunny. EP 23 'The Inner Circle' If you like Deangelo then okay but I hated him and this is an episode just about him. EP 24 'Dwight K. Shrute (acting) Manager' This one is just mediocre and the characters aren't at their best.

Season 8: EP 14-18 depends on how much you like the Tallahassee Plot. I think it's alright but some people really don't like it. EP 21 'Angry Andy' is pretty bad because it's just the entire office humiliating Andy while they pretend it's alright for Nellie to steal his job.

Season 9:EP 10 'Lice' is pretty bad. EP 12 'Customer Loyalty' most of it is good but the end is just very hard for me to watch. EP 20 'Paper Airplane' Both plots are trash and the next 3 episodes are great.

That's it. If you find any mistakes just let me know.",DunderMifflin,1593513201,Taltos_69,4,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hikua4/notes_on_rewatching_the_office/,1,True,submission,2020-06-30

Michael and the Buy-out,"I just watched this episode for the first time and my jaw dropped when I saw what an amazing negotiater Michael is.

It's so cool how his character has layers. On top he's this awkward and weird guy but beneath that he's actually incredibly smart as shown when he convinces Pam and Ryan to trade the 60k to come back to Dunder Mifflin. He's thoughtful too because he insisted on them both coming back as Salesmen which Pam didn't even know she wanted.

It really annoys me that I'm getting close to the last episode with Michael, his character really tied the show together. It's no wonder the office didn't survive very long after he left.",DunderMifflin,1592630538,Nothing_2_sneeze_at,4,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hcgdz2/michael_and_the_buyout/,1,True,submission,2020-06-20

Shouldn't of Michael Scott Paper Company faild?,"--Let me just prefecit this a analysis/question of logic gaps a show or other works may or may not have.--

Predatory pricing is the illegal act of setting prices low in an attempt to eliminate the competition. Predatory pricing violates antitrust law, as it makes markets more vulnerable to a monopoly.

Couldn't David Wallace just have threatened legal action against Micheal, knowing he couldn't financially defend against it because his business was so new?

Jim and Pam's Wedding,"Okay, I know this has been discussed to death already and many people might skip this post just for the title, and most people like to trash on this episode, this wedding is something I can totally identify with.

My entire family and all my friends seem to expect that any wedding they go to is a huge affair with lots of people and lots of money. However, the line, ""Why did we invite so many people?"" really reverberated with me.  Friends/family/society/etc may pressure the, into a big wedding, which inevitably ends up being a day full of other people's drama, when really they just wanted a private ceremony that was just for them. 

Is it a little cheesy that they ran off and left everyone waiting? Yes. Is it too unbearably cute to excuse that Jim planned an entire plan B wedding just in case Pam got too nervous to do it in front of a hundred people? Absolutely not. 

I think it's important to understand that small, private weddings are just as valid as enormous public spectacle weddings, depending on the specific needs/wants/desires of the wedding party. Also, a small, for real wedding, before some kind of grand/traditional wedding is totally okay if it's right for you and your partner.

In the end, the Jim/Pam wedding is not my absolute least favorite episode, and maybe not my favorite, but it brings up some very valid points in a modern engagement that myself and perhaps many other find touching. And before anyone asks, yes the dance scene to ""Forever"" makes me ugly cry every time. It's just too damn cute to watch them watch each other while their friends make complete fools of themselves and know that everything is going to be okay. 

That's all and thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",DunderMifflin,1592637210,Ikthala,16,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hchnm0/jim_and_pams_wedding/,1,True,submission,2020-06-20

My evolving opinions on Jim Halpert,"The first time I saw the show, I loved Jim and Pam and saw them as the protagonists, like a lot of people seeing the show for the first time. The second time I watched it I really did not like Jim because of his immaturity in the office and his childish pranks on Dwight. He just seemed so patronizing and pretentious the second time watching the show, and Pam seemed to get more and more stuck up as the show went on. Overall, I did not like the couple at all the second time watching the show. Now, I am on my fifth time watching The Office, and I have a completely different view of Jim. I honestly feel bad for the guy because he always has good intentions and is always willing to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. For example, when he and Michael Scott become co-managers, he tells Michael about his strong attributes and VERY lightly tells him of his negative attributes. He is always trying to make people happy. He is also very kind to Dwight like when Dwight is debating whether to give his pee for Michaels drug test and give up his volunteer sheriffs deputy badge, Jim goes out of his way to give Dwight guidance which is immediately disregarded. I just feel like, although Jim is pretty childish in the way he judgementally handles certain relationships with his coworkers, he tries to make up for it in a kindhearted way that I did not realize after multiple watches. I’m curious what fellow office fanatics have to say about this.  And also when I saw the show the first time, I thought Jim and pams love story was admirable in the way Jim pursued her from the beginning, but the second time, I kinda saw jim as a bad guy just ignoring Roy’s side of the situation and ruining an engagement. Now, I see it like, Jim knew Pam would definitely be happier in a different life without Roy because they obviously did not have the same chemistry as Jim and her did. and that was basically proven true as both Pam and Roy ended up happier without each other, and this kind of made me focus less on Jim being selfish and more just being reasonable and actually realistic on what is best for everyone. (Obviously he probably wouldn’t have been thinking of Roy, but still he probably knew the engagement wasn’t the most genuine) btw this is for fans beyond the Jim obsession and then beyond the Jim hatred..",DunderMifflin,1591775803,chipb15,2,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/h06cas/my_evolving_opinions_on_jim_halpert/,15,True,submission,2020-06-10

Breaking News! Toby is the Scranton Strangler.,"Yes. That's why he felt so bad about sentencing an innocent man for his deeds. That's why he wrote his detective novel in such a detail. It all begun with the frustration with Michael. He tried to help Micheal become a better person but it all was hopeless. Micheal just took advantage and torment Toby more and more. After all the frustration Toby gave up with his holy ideals, he abandoned God, his christian values. 'if there is God then how can there be Micheal!' he cried every night in total despair. 

After a while Toby discovered sinning as a way of handling the frustration. First he started little by little, throwing rubbish on the floor, not recycling properly. But then it was not enough he need to avenge the church for lying to him about everything he held dear for years. For if there was God and forgiveness there cannot be Micheal in this world. Soon Toby needed more, he started going to strip clubs, drinking and gambling. But at the same time he needed to be discreet, he needed his image of being the aloof of the office so that no one could even imagine his double life. After all, if anything Creed was the edgy one.

Time passed, but not Toby's despair. Micheal became worse, alcohol wasn't enough. Worst yet, Toby's wife left and took his daughter away. One of the main reasons Toby was managing to keep his hunger under control. That's when he realised he needed a women to keep him under control. Interacting with women gave him back his sanity at least temporary. It brought back the memories of when he had a normal family and never even known that prick Micheal. That awful awful prick. How much he hated him.

Then there was Pam. She was perfect for him. On one hand she worked in the same office and he could see her every day. And as he spent most of his time at work as there was no one to go home to he needed someone at work. Dunder Mifflin office didn't have many females that Toby couldn't relate to and that could relax Toby. Angela was to strict, it made her uncomfortable to interact with. Then the other two were hopelessly unattractive and Toby could not even come close to Toby's wife. Pam fit the description the best. But here again was Jim...

Jim was a problem. He needed to go. But killing coworkers would raise suspicion. Police would interview all of the office stuff first and Dwight might also be a pain in the ass. Therefore Jim had to be tolerated... at least for now.

There was another issue with Pam, her lack of interest in Toby. It of course was only a matter of time before Toby would woo her and sweep her of her feet. After all Jim done it and let's face it Jim is way few levels below the Toby charms. But, Toby wasn't sure. He wasn't sure about if he was ready to move on from his ex wife. Whether he would be prepared to sacrifice his daughter. At times he felt yes certainly, he must be committed to Pam, but doubt was still there at the back of his mind.

Battling these frustrations Toby hit alcohol harder. He became more demanding of strippers, ordering prostitutes became quiet a regular, furthermore he wanted these whores to suffer. After all they would do anything for some cash and Toby had plenty to give. At first, he enjoyed sex, they would do anything sexual and Toby liked it but after a short while it became regular and boring. Toby was bored. He started experimenting with sex. Toys, then bondage then more rough stuff and rougher and rougher. This was the only fun Toby had. Every day he left his work at the office hurrying to a new whore, new abuse. He felt like he could do anything to these creatures made for pure pleasure.

Then there was the first case. It came unexpectedly, as Toby was in the middle of his usual 'entertainment' he felt it wasn't enough. What if he would put his hands around her neck and gently squeeze. So he did. At first she smiled and continued. Toby smiled back, and squeezed harder. She started moving faster, gasping more so Toby squeezed more. He squeezed for his wife, his ruined life, his miserable job, Micheal that hated him, Pam that he could never get.

When Toby regained his mind and came out of his day dream he found a naked body next to him. He covered her up. Now this is exactly what he needed. This is exciting. He figured where to get rid of the body. No one would care for her anyway right. But it felt so good, such a relief.

Next day Michael told Toby  that he would shoot Toby twice instead of Hitler or Bin Ladden. That day there was a next murder. Another girl that one one would look for.

Time passed, Toby's practice became regular. He knew that he should stop but he kept coming back. He even quit once for a month or two, and yet back he was looking for a new girl for the night. Strangulling never got boring. Every victim had had their own story and in exchange Toby gave his.

But then police got him. No not him. Another guy. But for his crimes. They called him the Scranton Strangler. Really, Toby was shocked. He took great care to hide his victims and clear all the leads to him, but now police got some guy. How could that be...

The guy turned out to be some gardener who happened to find one of the bodies and found more bodies as Toby hid them near each other. Another women seen the guy pull bodies out from the ground. She called police. The gardener seeing police tried to explain himself but police pulled the gun in him and were going to arrest him. That was something that the poor bloke could not afford he already was on probation for a bar fight, if he gets into trouble he would face serious jail time. So without thinking he jumped for his car. Police shot, bullets whizzed past his head one even scratched his shoulder but he didn't feel anything. The adrenaline rush made sure he pressed down on the peddle and charged onwards. Police did catch up with him, shot out his tires and the chase was over. 

Back in the office Toby even felt guilty. He literally saw the police car chase out of his window. It should of been him behind that car, getting shot by police, being shown live on the news. It should be Toby. Instead he got a new round of humiliation from Michael. How much he would love to end Micheal then and here in his beloved office. But all the documentary crew would definitely catch something on their pesky cameras. Those things are constantly on! 

Events became more ironic. Toby was getting to grips with an innocent man going behind the bars. After all he was not that innocent and he wasn't Toby. But then, jury duty. Seriously! Toby got to be the jury in the case that he was guilty for. It was crazy. Maybe it is a sign from God or whatever that Toby must confess? Must he? Toby wrestled with this decision, day and night. All through the trial and through the hearing, all through listening and seeing the familiar places where Toby did his dirty deeds. One of the witnesses even recognised the defendant. Seriously, she didn't recognise Toby right there but an innocent man. 

Toby gave up. He was going to give in. He will do it. He thought long about how to do it best. First Toby will make sure that the defendant goes free. Then he will write a letter so that he can say final goodbyes to his work colleagues and Pam and surrender himself like a hero. Maybe it will make Pam notice him more. 

Toby tried hard to convince juries to vote innocent but nothing could save an innocent man going to prison for a long long time. Hearing passed. Verdict made. Man sentenced. He would never be free again. 

Toby could not sleep. Not this night, not yesterday, not this week. He was guilty and yet free. Now Toby need church more then ever. His salvation. His guilt pleasure. He needed forgiveness. But who can forgive him. To whom could he tell his crimes to? That's when it came to Toby. To the innocent man behind bars. Toby will see him and come clean. 

It again didn't go to plan. Even worse he nearly got strangled himself. After hearing the truth the prisoner charged at him. Toby actually felt that the two of them could even become friends. Toby really needed a friend and the falsely accused was now the best person for that. But instead of forgiveness Tony nearly lost his life and Toby wanted to live. So he will let that asshole rot in jail, after all that man was violent and maybe not less then Toby. 

But Toby still felt guilty. He needed to come clean. So he compromised. He would write a novel where he would confess his crimes and at the same time let people closest to him read it and judge him. But who were these people? His wife left him, he had no friends and his daughter was way too young. Toby settled for office coworkers. After all he did spend his 9-5 there for a few years now and they knew him so well. Let them judge. Meanwhile while they do that Toby wanted to get away, to get him time to think things over, about how to proceed. But where could he go. He needed to get out of US jurisdiction, somewhere with no chance of US getting him, where no extradition treaty is in place. Panama was a perfect fit. 

Toby's spent last two weeks before departure, writing up the stories. He gone thoroughly through every detail, changing only the names and the locations. And it was done a day before he was due to leave. Finally something went to plan for Toby. He left the printed version in the table, packed his things and gone to his farewell party. It was clear that Micheal was very pleased that Toby was leaving but had to hide it from his new girlfriend, Toby's replacement as HR rep. 

Well that is all we have on Toby as for now. He did  return to US and came back to his old job. We will be closely monitoring him for further evidence. He is a dangerous criminal and we need full caution to proceed with evidence to collection. I will see to it personally that we have our best agent in the field, potentially we can plant the agent in his work place for the best monitoring of the suspect. Let me know what you think and if I need to provide paperwork and a cover story for the latest Dunder Mifflin employee, if you get my gist.

"After rewatching the show for first time in 5 yrs, I’m pretty convinced Toby is the Scranton Stranger!","Why? 

1) He was pretty firm in his stance after the trial that wrong guy was convicted.
2) Toby was the only person missing during the chase.
3) he constantly talked about it the Scranton strangler obsessively for years up til the very end when Nelly told me to shut up about it. 
4) Does anyone also remember that creepy way he did the strangling motion in the conference room after being selected for jury? 
5) Michael hated Toby deeply for reasons the were not completely obvious. I always felt Michael was actually pretty intuitive(his personality type is usually suggested as ENFP) and I feel like deep down he felt uncomfortable with Toby. He hated him because he sensed something deeply troubling about him.

Phyllis and bob first time?,"I’m just confused about the whole Phyllis and bob Vance story about how they first had sex, now hear me out I’m not just some weirdo wondering about their sex time I’m just confused because Phyllis has multiple stories on how it happened.

I've just started watching The Office and I don't get why people like Michael Scott so much. In my opinion he's horrible.,"First off, let me make it clear that I don't say he's horrible in a ""badly written fictional character"" sense. Its fiction, I get it, you're not supposed to like every character. He's fine in a meta sense.

I'm currently on season four atm, and beforehand I read that season one Michael was pretty bad and that he gets better by season three. I still have not reached the same conclusion.

What I don't like is Michael as a person, if I were to be in that universe working under/with him. He's a horrible boss, friend, and a horrible person in general. He's self-centred, tunnel-visioned, only cares about himself and does not care about how his actions can negatively affect others at all. He constantly creates trouble for others, often times just due to his selfishness like how he wants to make his own ads, refusing to adapt to a better business model, and generally being a bad human being to people that disagrees with him. I feel so bad for Toby. He's just trying to do his job, and Michael always have to make his life hard for Toby just because he's too childish to accept rational ideas and decisions that Toby makes that go against his selfish ideas. He badmouths others who doesn't go with what he wants, and ruins things for other people without batting an eye. I just don't see why Michael is so well-liked. 


This is different from liking a child despite their sometimes selfish and bad behaviour, he is a grown adult in a position of power whose actions can severely impact people's lives very negatively. He could literally ruin his workers' lives if his shenanigans get out of line. He rarely has other people's best interest in mind, he just does whatever he wants. He's so self absorbed in his own world to realise his incompetency and how that negatively affects others around him. People thinks that his childlike quality is endearing, and when he does nice stuff it's nice, but I just see a guy that never cares about someone else's best interest, and rarely his self-centred attitude positively affects others ie. Pam's art show. He wasn't being nice, he was just being dumb in his own way and liked Pam's drawings. He wasn't thinking ""I should be nice to Pam and show appreciation for her efforts"". He was just thinking ""oh this painting is good"".

To summarize, he is not a villian or something of that sort, but he is that dumb weird kid in class that does whatever he wants, which could be endearing and nice in the right setting, but when he is in a position of power like a manager, being like that just causes unnecessary problems for others. He's okay as a character for me, but horrible as a person. I don't think he gets to be demeaning and destructive to others just because he's not bright and wants to be liked. He doesn't want the best for others, he wants what he wants.",DunderMifflin,1590919208,TanTannyTanTan,22,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/gtwfo4/ive_just_started_watching_the_office_and_i_dont/,1,True,submission,2020-05-31

Unpopular opinion re Andy Bernard,"Am I one of the few people really happy about the way his character arc ended, he ended up with his dream job at his favourite place in the world.

 I think everyone assumes that his character had to echo Jim's and be with Erin, but let's be real Plop was a far better fit for her. He's waaaay more caring and attentive to her needs. I think that for Erin, Andy was her first love but it was always going to end in disaster. Andy was always self destructed and would have done so at some point. 

After re watching the series again I believe that each character had there own arcs and end goals.

Jim and Pam were looking for love and a happy family life together.

Angela always wanted to be with Dwight.

Dwight always wanted to be Manager.

Stanley just wanted to be left alone until he could retire.

And Andy just wanted respect from his parents and peers.",DunderMifflin,1590067531,Zs2990,7,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/gnwsy2/unpopular_opinion_re_andy_bernard/,1,True,submission,2020-05-21

Meredith Discontinuity,"Small discontinuity regarding Meredith that several have noticed between season 1 and 4. In addition to Jim’s note in Meredith’s B-Day card (S1E4) stating she is an accountant when she is later revealed to be in supplier relations, her B-Day date is also changed later on. In the same episode (S1E4), Pam points to April 10th, (calendar of 2005) saying the next B-Day is Merediths, then says that isn’t until next month, being March currently. But in S4E1 we learn Creed’s B-Day is November 1st and in S4E7 (irrelevant but set in 2007) Angela says to Jim, “Kelly’s was last week remember? It’s B-Day month, Creed’s is today, Oscars is the week after next, Meredith’s is at the end of the month.” Obviously, there were continuity problems at the beginning but for those interested, I figured I’d go more in depth since I started taking notice when I realized I share a B-Day with Creed... 

Based on the page she is open to in S1E4, the current day would be around March 24-25, making that Ryan’s B-Day if the continuity held.

Just out of curiosity, has anyone been able to deduct when the B-Day of the other characters are? (Based on info given in the show)",DunderMifflin,1589183229,Sharkey_E,1,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/ghj848/meredith_discontinuity/,1,True,submission,2020-05-11

Drug Testing Episode,"Season 2 Episode 20, Dwight finds a joint in the parking lot and proceeds to do an investigation into whose it was. It culminates in him drug testing the entire office, yet Michael is seemingly the only one concerned. Surely there would be a few at least weed users in a middle class office in Scranton (or anyplace really). Obviously Creed but he probably had a clean urine hookup on speed dial. Ryan's a young guy who likes to go to parties and he uses drugs once he gets promoted to corporate. He also mentions in the episode he doesn't think Michael has ever done drugs because no one has ever offered him any which implies that Ryan has been offered and decided to partake at some point. Then Kelly mentions in the episode that Ryan and his friends pressure her into partying with them. While I don't see her smoking on her own, I could see her doing it to impress Ryan. Jim seems like a solid maybe although there's nothing in the show to indicate, I know a lotta guys like Jim that partake occasionally. Pam is also a maybe for me because I get a feeling that Roy smokes and she might occasionally do it with him. Once again no evidence, just a hunch. Meredith is an alcoholic but loves to party, I don't even think she knows what she'd pop positive for, I'd expect her to at least be worried.

Is Pam psychopath?,"She takes her coffee black with just a sprinkle of cinnamon....!?!?!?!

This has bothered me since the very first time this episode aired (s5 e7 customer survey)

First of all cinnamon doesn’t really dissolved which is why it’s used mostly to sprinkle on top of foam in cappuccinos for aesthetic. Or you can brew it into your coffee for flavor. 

But when her classmate asks her what she wants in her coffee she says (in time with jim) ‘Sprinkle with Cinnamon.’ Which means she is drinking a black coffee with an unflavored sawdust on top....!?!

Reasons I dislike Jim that have nothing to do with his romantic relationships,"I have no real problem w Jim's behavior in his relationships. No one is perfect, especially when it comes to love/dating, so it's whatever.

My problem with Jim is simply that he is smug (smudge) and entitled. He thinks he's better than everyone in the office, both personally and professionally. He doesn't put any effort into his job and looks down on people like Dwight for taking it seriously. When he pulls a prank on Dwight that either jeopardizes his work or distracts him, Jim thinks it's hilarious. But the second Dwight or Michael do something similar to him, he acts like they are children. The few times Jim stopped judging everyone &amp; actually goofed around with them were some of his more redeeming moments.

The moment when I dislike Jim the most is when he is upset with Michael for not recommending him for a promotion. Why on earth does Jim deserve a promotion???? He does the absolute bare minimum for the company. I didn't see anything leading up to that point that made me feel like Jim was a good employee or leader. I understand being upset about not being recommended for a promotion, but Jim handled it so poorly and looked really entitled. I'm pretty sure it's hinted that Michael didn't recommend him because he wanted Jim to stay, but in my opinion Jim never deserved the promotion anyways so it shouldn't have even mattered.

I could go on and on about things that annoy me about him because honestly I just don't like his personality and end up rolling my eyes at him at least once an episode. I like when characters are flawed, but the reason this is different is that everyone in the Office universe acts like Jim is great and deserves so much praise. We're meant to think that Jim is the sane one instead of his character being questionable like the rest of the characters. Same w Pam but we're not talking about her right now.

I loved when Jim got the bad customer reviews because I thought he would finally get some criticism, but then it was pretty much meaningless since Kelley only wrote the reviews to get back at him for forgetting her party. Same thing with Charles. I loved that he wasn't crazy about Jim, but again it was completely switched around and they made it look like Charles was in the wrong.

Ryan calling Jim out about never taking anything seriously and asking if his whole schtick ever gets old is one of my favorites lol same with Oscar not wanting him to join the finer things club. Because these are some of the few times people other than Dwight call him out.

What do you think?? Am I too hard on Jim? Maybe I'm biased by the fact that I think he's an annoying person to begin with so that makes his negative traits stand out more. Try to keep the responses focused on Jim himself rather than his relationship with Karen/Pam since I feel like that topic has already been discussed a lot!",DunderMifflin,1587452324,watchmewatchthings,19,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/g5afcs/reasons_i_dislike_jim_that_have_nothing_to_do/,1,True,submission,2020-04-21

Does Michael get likable?,"So with lockdown I thought I would watch the office after seeing some memes online and being a fan of John Krasinski. I'm on season 2 episode 13 and on the whole really enjoy it. Love Jim and Pam. Dwight is hilarious. Most of them are. Love the pranks. 

The issue is Michael. I've genuinely never disliked a character more on a sitcom. He is probably the biggest arsehole I have ever watched and every scene is he in is just horrible. He is racist, sexist, misogynistic, selfish. He is an awful ""friend"", he is an awful boss. He is lazy, insensitive, thinks he is hilarious when he never is. He constantly annoys people and betrays them. He thinks he is better than everyone. I could go on and on about all his horrible traits. He has no redeeming qualities at all bar the fact he doesn't want anyone fired and even that becomes a selfish motivation. I'm literally waiting for the character growth and improvement but it doesn't come.

Does he get any better? Because every other part of the show is genuinely great, I have laughed so many times, Jim and Pam might be one of my favourite pairings ever and I am so invested in literally every other character but I've never seen a show where the lead is so unlikable and I long for him to get off the screen and frankly just be cut from the show. Maybe it's because I'm British and the joke of his character doesn't translate well?

Just watched the ep where michael Scott leaves,"Honestly, when I first started watching, i never thought I would tear up when he leaves. I found him to be really annoying and quite a bit of a dick to the people around him but over the seasons, I really got to like Michael for all that he is, his ridiculousness in the office, his racist and inappropriate remarks and lastly how he was really just a sad man that had no friends but gained so many throughout his tenure in the office.

He really grabs your attention and his crazy antics are just so entertaining and he also seem like the most genuine guy laying it all out there even tho he says so many wrong things

I really like him as a character as you got to know him, and his holly relationship was great. I was kinda shipping them right from the beginning and then they sent her off so I'm really glad they got together.

I'm gonna continue until the end of the series and I will be so sad when its over. It took a while to grow on me to be honest, but I love all the characters, even creed .... and gabe (I love to hate him).",DunderMifflin,1586598069,ChilliWithFries,5,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fz1c1k/just_watched_the_ep_where_michael_scott_leaves/,1,True,submission,2020-04-11

I have a question,In one of the more early episode Michael wanted to throw a party for enthusiasm. They said that the closest birthday is Meredith but it was a month too early for her birthday.  But in “Survivor man” (season 4 episode 3) they say that there is 3 birthdays ahead of Meredith.  Merediths is stated that hers is at the end of the month and doing the math hers is only 2 weeks after oscars birthday. Did Merediths birthday somehow get changed?,DunderMifflin,1585719646,xdawe,2,/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fstmwg/i_have_a_question/,1,True,submission,2020-04-01

My own Cold Opening for the Corona Situation,"*10-15 Asian People enters the office bullpen*

Dwight: Ohh no! You guys are the reason for Corona Outbreak. Get out of my office. Michael! MICHAEL! MICHAEL! 

Mike: Calm down! CALM DOWN EVERYBODY! 

Dwight: Michael what are these Bat eating wusses doing in our office. Remand them please. 

Mike: No Dwight. I appointed these Chinese People to show that we don't hate the Chinese but just the government for hiding such an important outbreak from us for months. 

Asian 1: Tha..

Mike: No, don't have to thank me. I'm just doing my best as the *Shows his cup* World's Best Manager. 

Asian 2: But y...

Mike: No, its alright, I'll do my part as an American citizen to show support to fellow people living in America.

Dwight: Anyway, this is a time to show whose immunity is best. Stanley, Meredith and Phillys, hope you have your coffins and wills ready. 

Everyone: DWIGHT! 

Dwight: Come on! Like you people haven't thought about it. 

*Dwight walks away* 

Oscar: Don't worry Stanley and Phillys, wash your hands frequently to stop from Corona attacking you. 

Kevin: Yes, wash your hands. Especially you Oscar. 

Oscar: What do you mean by especially me? 

Mike: Alright Stop i.. 

Angela: *breaking Mike* We know where your hands have been. 

Meredith: We should cover our nose and mouth so that we don't get affected. 

*Removes her top to reveal bare top body and ties that as a face mask*

Kevin: That's what I'm talking about. 

Mike: *Snaps a pic*

Toby: Mike? Did you run by me that you're hiring people? 

Mike: No, because I'm transferring you to Wuhan effective last decade. Get lost Toby! 

Creed: *Talks to Asians* You're the reason for this outbreak. I'll be watching you always. 

Kelly: I just want Ryan and I to catch it at the same time so that we will be isolated together

Ryan: *Cough*

Kelly: Ohh my God Babe. Sneeze on my face now. I need what you have. 

Jim: Alright, Pam. Time to take our maternity leave. 

Stanley: Damn boy. Third child huh? When are you expecting? 

Jim: I don't know, maybe in 9 months. See you. 

Pam: Stop Joking Jim. This is a good thing Michael has done. Appreciate you Michael

Asian 1: Yeah but tha... 

Mike: No. Nope. Anyone can work here except Toby. Have fun working here

*Dwight reenters the room wearing a HAZMAT Suit in his car boot* 

Asian 1: *To Pam* I don't know when I can, but I have been trying to tell Mike that we are all from Japan and not China. And he never gave us a chance to tell it for like 20+ hours.

I’ve heard a lot of hate about and I’m just wondering what your opinions are.

For those that don’t know what I’m talking about, season 9, episode 17. It’s Bascically an episode where around half of it is centered around the Schrute family and the neighboring farms family, it was different from a normal office episode and presented like a premiere for a new tv show.

Sad Holly had to move but I’m kind of confused why she can date that guy that lives at the other office and couldn’t date Michael, unless it was because he was the manager.

Talking heads from the COVID19 episode,"Dwight-  I'm not afraid of the Coronavirus.. Mose and I have prepared for this sort of thing our entire lives.... However, The possibility of Human-Bat hybrids is slightly intimidating...

Creed- I contracted the Coronavirus in the early 70s... I could breathe just fine.. but it really did a number on my genitals...

Kevin- I literally just bought 400$ worth of girl scout cookies... I'll be just fine.... 

Michael- Working with Toby is basically the same as having the Corollavirus... He makes everyone sick and... cancels any sign of fun ever.... being in the same building as him is literally killing me....
